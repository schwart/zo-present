[15/09/2023, 22:16:46] conall: Using every fibre of my being not to send an iMessage
[15/09/2023, 22:18:21] conall: I’ll let you know about Weds. I may have to do some moving BS that night but I’m hoping not. Depends on the new landlord but I’ll let you know asap

Really enjoyed meeting you, have a good weekend and I’ll see you next week
[16/09/2023, 06:42:52] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I really hope you actually use WhatsApp in your day to day life and I haven’t just dragged you into a room of the internet for my own ease
[16/09/2023, 06:45:15] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Oh yeah of course don’t worry - I actually could do Monday coming or some time Sat/Sun if any of those are easier! Was lovely meeting you too 😌
[16/09/2023, 10:11:07] conall: oh yeah don’t worry, I‘ve only got about 5 people I send imessages to. They’re like those japanese soldiers they found in the 70’s that thought WW2 was still going
[16/09/2023, 10:12:11] conall: Monday will be best I reckon, saves me / my new landlord faffing you around
[16/09/2023, 12:08:57] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Honestly when people text me I’m like what year do you think this is
[16/09/2023, 12:09:22] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Ok!! Monday as in two days from now yes?
[16/09/2023, 14:24:06] conall: might as well use carrier pigeon (which tbh does sound fun if I didn’t feel bad for the little birds)
[16/09/2023, 14:24:35] conall: yeah that’s the guy. We could go to levvie? I’ve barely been and fancy checking it out, I bet you’ve got some good haunts there
[16/09/2023, 17:03:13] Zoë “cringe” Turner: So here’s another thing about (up and coming) east manchester
[16/09/2023, 17:05:09] Zoë “cringe” Turner: None of the good places tend to be open until Wednesday
[16/09/2023, 17:09:04] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Having said this I’ve just googled and at least two spots I like do exist on Mondays but I would probs recommend trekking here when there’s more available??? Is Chorlton good at Mondays?

[16/09/2023, 17:16:32] conall: Chorlton (plateauing, possibly declining) has plenty we can go to. There’s a nice bar called Man Bites Dog, let’s go there
[16/09/2023, 17:17:21] conall: big fan of this, it looks like it’s been sat on. Consider it loved on my end
[16/09/2023, 17:17:41] conall: also you’ve got the same plant as me, I don’t know what the name of it is but it falls asleep at night
‎[16/09/2023, 17:18:06] conall: ‎<attached: 00000021-PHOTO-2023-09-16-17-18-06.jpg>
[16/09/2023, 18:14:08] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Do you mean Man Bites Frog or have they opened a sister location? Funny either way
[16/09/2023, 18:14:40] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Do you remember that dress that everyone went crazy about on the internet re whether it was blue or not blue
[16/09/2023, 18:14:47] Zoë “cringe” Turner: That’s what the pot looks like I think
[16/09/2023, 18:15:35] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This guy!!!! They’re so lovely aren’t they. Like hello yes it is day time now
[16/09/2023, 19:41:12] conall: I wish, they haven’t opened a sister location I’m just an oaf
[16/09/2023, 19:41:36] conall: words are not my strong suit
[16/09/2023, 19:42:49] conall: Is it meant to be gold?!
[16/09/2023, 19:43:40] conall: also I don’t get why it isn’t finished, it looks all done to me. I love how wonky it is
[16/09/2023, 19:44:11] conall: They’re ace, I wish I knew what it was called. What other plants you got?
[16/09/2023, 20:18:14] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Good job you’re fluent in bowls and stuff init
[16/09/2023, 20:19:55] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahaha imagine, illusion paint. No I just know the ruffles are totally the same vibe
[16/09/2023, 20:20:31] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Where is the bottom???! What is it for???! - said still with respect and love
[16/09/2023, 20:22:37] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It’s called an oxalis triangularis apparently 🫶 and I have several that are dying because I’m not very good at remembering to water them, even a rubber plant which are famously hard to kill right??
[16/09/2023, 20:34:48] conall: I’ve just remembered I recently downloaded an app that tells me these things
‎[16/09/2023, 20:35:01] conall: ‎<attached: 00000036-PHOTO-2023-09-16-20-35-01.jpg>
[16/09/2023, 20:35:14] conall: (I am a very exciting person)
[16/09/2023, 20:35:57] conall: I’m the same tbf. I’ve got a big wall of them in my room and I still forget to water them. Absolutely useless
[16/09/2023, 20:36:39] conall: hahahahahaha I didn’t really clock there was no bottom, I just thought it was a fun little shelf thing
[16/09/2023, 20:38:48] conall: also I went to the book shop you recommended today! I was cycling around and remembered when I got to dids, it’s ace. Got two books, thanks for the recc
[16/09/2023, 20:55:26] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This IS exciting - how else would I have known it’s actually called a false shamrock??
[16/09/2023, 20:55:56] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ‘Introduced’ 🥹
[16/09/2023, 20:56:30] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Does the relationship status deepen the more you spot it..?
[16/09/2023, 20:56:57] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Really! That’s so nice! What did you find???
[16/09/2023, 20:57:25] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Did I tell you it used to be looked after by this really sweet really old man and then the pandemic happened and he wasn’t there anymore :(
[16/09/2023, 21:10:39] conall: I’ve got more facts if you’d like. Well one more fact but I did go “ahhh” when I worked it out
[16/09/2023, 21:11:14] conall: sadly it just means it’s not endemic, I’ll never deepen my relationship with my false shamrock
[16/09/2023, 21:11:30] conall: I feel like it’s my spirit plant. I’ve got a very irish name but I’m not irish. I’m a false shamrock!
[16/09/2023, 21:14:00] conall: Aw that explains a lot tbh. It was suspiciously lacking any staff in the back, you just bring the books to the coffee shop and they ask you how much they cost
‎[16/09/2023, 21:14:39] conall: ‎<attached: 00000050-PHOTO-2023-09-16-21-14-39.jpg>
[17/09/2023, 07:18:09] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Tell me the fact
[17/09/2023, 07:19:37] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This was a big reach in interpretation from me here. Your explanation makes so much more sense given this is a plant app
[17/09/2023, 07:20:38] Zoë “cringe” Turner: it’s true! Also I’ve just saved you as Conall Patrick in my phone because I couldn’t remember your third Very Irish name
[17/09/2023, 07:21:48] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Wow you’re really going for this completion of the art history timeline and I respect it
[17/09/2023, 07:22:19] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Did you remember what that fun thing you were gonna do with your Sunday was?
[17/09/2023, 08:20:07] conall: they’re a distant relative of the sweet potato, I did some species tree walking and it turns out they’re BOTH dicots

unsure what a dicot is but it’s the class they’re in
[17/09/2023, 08:21:00] conall: I enjoyed it. I want to get to “it’s complicated” with my false shamrock
[17/09/2023, 08:21:50] conall: Tbf that’s better than what I’ve got you saved as (Zoë Plath) you’re at least using some parts of my real name
[17/09/2023, 08:25:02] conall: ALSO last night I was chatting to my mates brother’s girlfriend (tenuous I know) cos they were DJing at Night and Day, I actually said the phrase “oh wow is that a Mr Preston tattoo?”

She said yes and wondered how I knew. It was just the same style as yours, but I did feel very worldly and knowledgeable for about 3 seconds
[17/09/2023, 08:26:14] conall: I can’t! Very annoying. I have a few things I’d like to do though however I’m very hungover so I’m unsure how far I’ll get with any of it. What did you get up to last night?
[17/09/2023, 08:53:00] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This is insane, I wonder if all dicots taste the same…. ?? Also when you say species tree walking do you mean like an actual walk through the trees to find dicots or is this something else
[17/09/2023, 08:53:34] Zoë “cringe” Turner: A brave goal to have
[17/09/2023, 08:54:31] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahaha great, like I’m distantly related to someone who put her head in the oven 😎
[17/09/2023, 08:56:34] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Amazing. She would have felt such an affinity with you in that moment. Someone came up to me in a club once and we had like a ten minute shouty conversation (because it was loud but also I guess excitement) cause she knew his stuff and really wanted one too. He might be a tattoo guy but his larger scale work is forging connections across the city
[17/09/2023, 08:57:38] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Ew, I hate this feeling. Very bad at being hungover as I’d much rather be enjoying myself and always try to do things but inevitably feel worse, sending prayers
[17/09/2023, 08:59:02] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Last night I watched (3) hours of Wilderness that new series where Jenna Coleman wants to murder her cheating husband - felt unsure about the revenge feminism angle and the British caricatures of an American series - then fell asleep at 9.30. So I’m doing ok
[17/09/2023, 09:08:51] conall: you can just tell me to eat a leaf of my plant, I can see that’s what you’re angling after
[17/09/2023, 09:18:10] conall: nah much more boring. If you want to find relative species you basically walk up the tree, then walk back down it. How many steps you have to take it sort of how closely related they are
[17/09/2023, 09:19:47] conall: hilarious, I think tattoo people have a whole world that I’m just not party too. It’s very cute. I feel like I’ve had a look behind the veil. My mate who I’m moving in with lent me her hoodie once and I think she said it was his design. It’s bright pink, very warm.

I was going to ask if you have any other tattoos but that question is probably best in person
[17/09/2023, 09:20:53] conall: My Mum’s watching that atm and she said loosely the same thing. Wasn’t sure how she felt about it. Being asleep at 9:30 is an absolute dream though, I commend your clear headed-ness
[17/09/2023, 09:22:04] conall: speaking of revenge feminism, I was reading Plath’s wikipedia page (very bleak, made me want to read her though) and apparently her grave stone has been vandalised a few times because it has “Hughes” on it
[17/09/2023, 09:22:19] conall: You’re working today right?
[17/09/2023, 13:08:04] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Was it this transparent / have you done it yet
[17/09/2023, 13:08:48] Zoë “cringe” Turner: STILL ON THE APP I’m with you now; no real forests, why do I keep trying to make this something it’s not
[17/09/2023, 13:11:49] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Oh yeah he does do clothes too!!! Sounds like a winner - you were a tattoo person for that brief time where you were I assume cold. I have quite a few others, most of them silly, but yes I can fill you in tomorrow
[17/09/2023, 13:12:34] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Me 🤝
[17/09/2023, 13:12:47] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ^ your mum. Sent too fast
[17/09/2023, 13:13:04] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Not just ‘your mum’ing you, worst insult of all time
[17/09/2023, 13:14:20] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ahhhhhh this is interesting. Cancelled in retrospect, embarrassing for him. Annoying as well cause I did really like Birthday Letters
[17/09/2023, 13:15:33] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I am working yep, we’ve not had any weird visitors in ages so I hope we have one soon to spice up the afternoon
[17/09/2023, 14:57:32] conall: yes / yes. It was fine. Not sweet. Not a potato
[17/09/2023, 14:57:56] conall: you’ve got a wonderful imagination
[17/09/2023, 14:59:50] conall: I was cold, but the warm embrace of the tattoo community heard my cries. Beautiful really. 

I look forward to hearing about the rest! I was trying to remember the Plath quote yesterday but I was very drunk and couldn’t stop thinking about ovens
[17/09/2023, 15:05:00] conall: I’d never heard of him! Poetry always confuses me. I always think I just don’t get it. Who’s your fave poet?
[17/09/2023, 15:05:34] conall: got my fingers crossed for you
[17/09/2023, 16:11:59] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I feel like we’ve been tricked by nature. Kinda the same as when people tell me we have the same language pattern as birds. What does it mean ??? Well done for investigating though thanks
[17/09/2023, 16:14:22] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Oh do you wanna read maybe my favourite poem ever? It’s by Hera Lindsay Bird, she is from New Zealand and is so deadpan but simultaneously in love with the world. She once signed one of my books of hers with an alligator… I think? I need to check what the animal was
[17/09/2023, 16:14:48] Zoë “cringe” Turner: None of them came today. But they’ll be back soon enough
[17/09/2023, 16:51:30] conall: I don’t know but I’d like to, please direct me to a quaint coffee / book shop that will have the answers. I’m thinking of entering my bird era about a month from now
[17/09/2023, 16:52:03] conall: I’ve started a new classification system, I feel the order / genus / species stuff is a bit too much for today’s budding biologists to deal with
[17/09/2023, 16:52:10] conall: I propose this
‎[17/09/2023, 16:52:17] conall: ‎<attached: 00000092-PHOTO-2023-09-17-16-52-17.jpg>
[17/09/2023, 16:52:36] conall: More plants will be added to the system in due course
[17/09/2023, 16:54:22] conall: Love the name already, what’s the title of the poem? You’ll need to explain more about how she signed something with an alligator. Did she pick it up and dip it’s tail in some ink?
[17/09/2023, 18:49:03] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Omg
[17/09/2023, 18:50:06] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Vegetables too??? Because if so I just had aubergines for tea and can you add Aubergine somewhere North West
‎[17/09/2023, 18:50:48] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ‎<attached: 00000097-PHOTO-2023-09-17-18-50-48.jpg>
[17/09/2023, 18:51:12] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This is very map of the UK on the table
[17/09/2023, 18:52:59] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Ok first of all you know exactly what I meant
[17/09/2023, 18:53:40] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Secondly it’s this one: https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/145468/pyramid-scheme
[17/09/2023, 18:54:15] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Intrigued to know if this one confuses you - be entirely honest
[17/09/2023, 19:54:02] conall: I’ll get it added pronto
[17/09/2023, 19:55:44] conall: okay I have re-read and see what you mean now, I didn’t think she picked the alligator up but I also didn’t get that she drew one either. My brain refuses to cooperate today, thank you for your patience
[17/09/2023, 19:56:39] conall: I’ll read it now and let you know what I reckon, cheers for sending it!
[17/09/2023, 19:59:02] conall: I really like that
[17/09/2023, 20:00:31] conall: I don’t really have the vocabulary to say why it’s good, but I really enjoyed it. Very “makes my brain think of a fun image” whatever the word for that is
[17/09/2023, 20:01:10] conall: also what time would you like to meet at Man Wears Cloggs tomorrow? 7?
[17/09/2023, 21:14:50] Zoë “cringe” Turner: You’re so welcome, I felt I just had to stay with you there for a bit
[17/09/2023, 21:18:06] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Success !! I don’t think I can sum it up very well either, I just think it’s gorgeous and switches tones in all the right places
[17/09/2023, 21:19:21] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Lololol. Yes 7 is fine. Currently feel like I’m coming down with something but hoping another obnoxiously long sleep sorts me out
‎[18/09/2023, 05:27:00] conall: ‎<attached: 00000111-PHOTO-2023-09-18-05-27-00.jpg>
[18/09/2023, 05:28:57] conall: woke up at 5 again. I will attempt a nap after work, I don’t want to be seen as a yawner
[18/09/2023, 05:31:20] conall: Yeah it’s great. It’s got a really effortless quality to it, really impressive. I read it again just as I woke up and I keep spotting more bits I like. Thanks again for sharing it, let me know what others from this poet you like, I’m a fan
[18/09/2023, 05:33:41] conall: Cool, I’ll make sure to be there at 6:45 to balance out the previous date. Hopefully see you later if you’re feeling well
[18/09/2023, 08:27:56] Zoë “cringe” Turner: We all yawn. Yesterday someone was practicing their gallery tour with me and I yawned. That’s way worse isn’t it
[18/09/2023, 08:29:04] Zoë “cringe” Turner: You’ve placed satsuma really well here
[18/09/2023, 08:30:25] Zoë “cringe” Turner: How lovely!! You’re very welcome - I literally like all of her stuff but there’s another amazing one called Monica as in Monica from friends
[18/09/2023, 08:31:11] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I don’t watch Friends because it doesn’t make me laugh but I understood her dissection of Monica all the same
[18/09/2023, 08:32:29] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I should hope so since this one is a mere walk away from your house
[18/09/2023, 10:44:58] conall: That is quite bad, although you do work there so you’re probably a bit bored of the gallery tour at this point. I don’t think I’ve ever had a gallery tour! I just wander round like a gnat hitting a window. I didn’t realise this was something I could do
[18/09/2023, 10:45:22] conall: Thanks, I’m a natural botanist it seems
[18/09/2023, 10:46:42] conall: Thank god this was the next question I was going to ask. Bit busy at work today but I’ll try to get to it before I see you at Fan Blows Smog later on
[18/09/2023, 10:47:04] conall: You manage to get a hefty sleep in? Hope you’re feeling a bit better today
[18/09/2023, 10:49:26] conall: (Don’t worry I’ll get bored of this joke soon enough. I know it’s not got legs on it)
[18/09/2023, 13:35:17] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I do so many of them and I really try to be 100% engaged but sometimes it just isn’t possible. Always make sure I have 3 feedback points that make it sound like I was really listening the whole way through though. You’d probably enjoy them, I suppose it’s different being there for pure leisure reasons
[18/09/2023, 13:35:44] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Somehow it’s still working for me hahahaha don’t worry
[18/09/2023, 13:36:42] Zoë “cringe” Turner: And yes thank u I’m feeling totally fine!!! Good to venture once more to the superior south
[18/09/2023, 16:03:04] conall: Yeah I don’t know how manage three points tbh. Sounds tough especially if you’re being a yawner (as we all are)
[18/09/2023, 16:03:13] conall: wahey! Looking forward to it
[18/09/2023, 16:03:32] conall: what fruit or vegetable would Gorton be if it was on this map
[18/09/2023, 16:03:40] conall: bonus points for Chorlton too
[18/09/2023, 17:20:27] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Gorton would be an onion that’s been in your cupboard too long
[18/09/2023, 17:20:41] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Chorlton = an exotic squash you can only get from Unicorn
[18/09/2023, 17:24:18] Zoë “cringe” Turner: How long does it take you to get to Man Fights Hog? I might be running a little late, didn’t know brown rice took 10 years to cook and I need to stop at a pharmacy
[18/09/2023, 17:24:23] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Tit for tat though
[18/09/2023, 18:05:33] conall: 7 minutes, depending on how the fight is going
[18/09/2023, 18:06:13] conall: You’ve gotta set the ground rules early, I respect it
[18/09/2023, 18:06:28] conall: Also I enjoy your interpretation of my question, good answers
[18/09/2023, 18:07:03] conall: I did type a long explanation but I’ll just tell you when I see you. I can use my trusty table prop
[18/09/2023, 18:08:44] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Who knew the table was so versatile
[18/09/2023, 18:08:56] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Ok shall I just let you know when I’m on the tram??
[18/09/2023, 18:10:21] conall: A tram?!
[18/09/2023, 18:10:24] conall: Yes that’s fine
[18/09/2023, 18:55:05] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m on the tram 🥲
[18/09/2023, 18:55:14] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Forewarning that I am feeling worse but trying
[18/09/2023, 18:55:34] conall: I’ve just arrived at Pam Spins Cog (my worst yet)
[18/09/2023, 18:55:38] conall: what a trooper
[18/09/2023, 18:55:58] Zoë “cringe” Turner: So many questions
[18/09/2023, 18:56:19] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Okay I’ll be 15/20 sorryyyy
[18/09/2023, 18:57:39] conall: Yeah don’t worry about it honestly, I was on autopilot. Unsure why I’m here but I can keep myself well entertained
[18/09/2023, 19:12:21] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Not far
[18/09/2023, 19:12:30] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Getting rained on
[18/09/2023, 19:16:00] conall: I’m in the back
[18/09/2023, 19:16:23] conall: Eating chips
[18/09/2023, 23:20:28] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Uber driver loves Fritaya (?)apparently
[18/09/2023, 23:24:52] conall: give that driver a 5 star rating immediately
[18/09/2023, 23:25:02] conall: Also not to nitpick, but it’s a frittata
[18/09/2023, 23:29:20] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Right, so they’re spelt the same as well
[18/09/2023, 23:29:34] Zoë “cringe” Turner: and you wonder why I was confused
[18/09/2023, 23:30:19] Zoë “cringe” Turner: he also told me that a) I sound like I’m from Manchester and b) that when he used to do drop offs in Gorton he would always see blood on the roads :)
[18/09/2023, 23:36:48] conall: Don’t worry I’m just being a knob, I think you’re right
[18/09/2023, 23:37:26] conall: High praise. You’ve officially escaped the clutches of your three tiered education system! Congrats
[18/09/2023, 23:37:36] conall: Cheers for a nice night, I hope you’ve manage to get home without being stabbed. Very excited to see these antique tiles on Sunday, I’ve had an idea for a project I want to make with one
[18/09/2023, 23:46:22] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yeah thanks I had fun, really shook me out of that downward sinus-spiral. You are not READY for the calibre of tiles (I’m so hoping I’m remembering this right).
[18/09/2023, 23:47:07] Zoë “cringe” Turner: You thought of this project between Morrisons wall and home? Buzzing to hear it
[19/09/2023, 08:04:54] conall: Very glad it did. I woke up this morning (at 7:30 no less) and read a bit of the wikipedia for sinusitis. Not that interesting. The CAT scan images made me realise how crazy eyes are, and mine have felt weird ever since
[19/09/2023, 08:05:31] conall: That wall is where I do my best thinking, you weren’t to know this. I had ulterior motives for suggesting it
‎[19/09/2023, 08:05:46] conall: ‎<attached: 00000168-PHOTO-2023-09-19-08-05-46.jpg>
[19/09/2023, 08:41:38] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Mildly offended that you weren’t further compelled by my ailment but nevermind. But yeah I understand how the eye thing would’ve come out on top, they’re so spherical. A friend showed me his brain scans recently and they made his nose look obscene it was so funny. Do you think it would be your eyes or your nose that stood out most on a CAT scan??
[19/09/2023, 08:42:58] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I feel used and the fritaya/frittata will only taste sour now
[19/09/2023, 10:27:20] conall: I read about various diagnoses then wondered what I was doing with myself. Also the eye thing put me off.

They’re awful aren’t they! I had a CAT and an MRI a couple of years ago (tinnitus / “time that isn’t appropriate convo for a second date” related), it’s mental to think that’s what I look like in some way. The medical system does not optimise for flattery
‎[19/09/2023, 10:27:42] conall: ‎<attached: 00000172-PHOTO-2023-09-19-10-27-42.jpg>
[19/09/2023, 10:29:03] conall: From the scans I remember being so focused on my eyes that I barely remember my nose at all. What do you reckon it’d be for you? Eyes or nose? I’m open to a rogue third option
[19/09/2023, 10:29:25] conall: That will only improve the flavour, you’ll thank me in time
[19/09/2023, 12:40:45] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Wooooooah. Is your right eyeball bigger than your left one?? I’m not sure I’d actually want to look at my head like this, would send me into a spin similar to ‘death is not a dark room’
[19/09/2023, 12:42:43] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also if you’re pretending that the arrow isn’t yours to avoid another compliment for how straight your lines are, don’t worry I’ve learnt to keep that admiration to myself
[19/09/2023, 12:44:03] Zoë “cringe” Turner: My skull is just so small I think everything would look ridiculous. People love telling me how small my head is. Maybe it wouldn’t even show up
[19/09/2023, 14:42:45] conall: I’m sorry to tell you that it’s not my eyes, nose or scan. I’m a fraud. This is just a scan of someone with chronic sinusitis. I do have a scan like this, I’m sure I can dig it out somewhere. Maybe I could do a cyanotype of it, that’d be a fun birthday present for my sister. I’m sure she’d love it
[19/09/2023, 14:43:28] conall: I’ll be crying out for arrow praise in time I’m sure of it. No doubt I’ll live to regret my decision to shut it down so cruelly
[19/09/2023, 14:46:05] conall: I haven’t noticed that you’ve got a small head, it seems proportional to me but it’s possible I have different standards for what a small head is. Do you ever wear hats? I like trying on the hats of people with tiny heads, it never gets old
[19/09/2023, 14:46:37] conall: also, how is the nose / steroid situation going? Any leads?
[19/09/2023, 16:03:10] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This spiralled. Reminds me of when my pal had scans of her empty womb for whatever reason and then kept them stuck to her fridge like a family photo. Anyway if you do go ahead and do that please let me know what your sister’s feedback is (it will still be better than my brother’s, when he got nothing)
[19/09/2023, 16:06:16] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I did some Googling of my own about Leo’s and it DID say that you guys LOVE praise and respect, something about being selfish too
[19/09/2023, 16:08:41] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I haven’t found my hat of choice yet so no, you could try my bike helmet though that’s always a good one. Me and my pal Sophie are kind of in a life long contest as to whose head is the smallest and when she put my helmet on it was far too small, so I guess I won. Thanks for telling me my head seems outwardly normal though
[19/09/2023, 16:10:08] Zoë “cringe” Turner: So…..turns out it’s fully available to private pharmacies that charge the double the price. Who knew 🥹 so I’ve taken the bait and now I’m part of the problem
[19/09/2023, 17:09:12] conall: Lots of questions about this, you can’t answer them though. I like the sound of that pal.

I don’t think I will. She doesn’t like me much (didn’t get me a card, I’m sure I mentioned that yesterday). She wouldn’t like the joke. Unsure what to get someone who doesn’t like you, I’m thinking a massage
[19/09/2023, 17:11:32] conall: Okay this made me reflexively google “leo selfish”. I have two comments:

1) This article is damning. I’m not like this! https://www.yourtango.com/2020337568/why-are-leos-so-selfish?amp

2) You’re actually more selfish than me according to the fine folks at So Syncd (very reliable source) https://www.sosyncd.com/the-most-selfish-zodiac-signs-ranked/
[19/09/2023, 17:13:28] conall: Thanks I look forward to looking silly for 2 seconds and saying “wow your head IS small”. I like the idea of a lifelong contest that can easily be ended at any time. Is she working to make her head smaller for a future rematch?
[19/09/2023, 17:20:08] conall: Great system, really great. I suppose you’re supposed to be thankful that you’re sorted now. I think that’s what’s expected of you anyway

Sarcasm aside I DO hope you feel less shite soon. I feel I’ve got a better understanding of how bad it is now I’ve skimmed the wikipedia page and got scared of eyeballs
[19/09/2023, 19:07:05] Zoë “cringe” Turner: As in really truly doesn’t like you or just doesn’t like you in a sister kind of way? I don’t think my brother really likes me either but we’re so fundamentally different I can just explain it away in that sense. A massage is definitely a ‘here to win you over’ kind of gift, bold
[19/09/2023, 19:13:04] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahahaha. Not even the part where they compare you to Regina George? (Weird cultural reference). 

Bit yikes that I’m second in the order of selfish signs but I’m going to focus on this poignant quote: ‘However, we all have a tendency to be selfish at some point, and it’s not all bad.’
And remind myself that we could just back and forth with different astrology links for days until we’d justified our personalities as we see fit but we won’t because we’re bigger than that
[19/09/2023, 19:16:04] Zoë “cringe” Turner: At this point I’m not entirely sure if either of us even wants to have the smallest head. I feel like I could leave better legacies
[19/09/2023, 19:19:51] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Of course!! Independentpharmacy.co.uk is my saviour, maybe I’ll just shop there from now on. But thank you, I do feel better, sorry for being dramatic about it. Hopefully you never have to see my eyeballs scanned like that HORROR SHOW
[19/09/2023, 19:20:27] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Are you pottering this eve?? Is that the word?
[19/09/2023, 21:40:33] conall: I just think she despises me, it has been noted by other family members. Very odd situation all round but I keep ignoring it and just cracking on anyway. Weird because the rest of my family and I get on very well
[19/09/2023, 21:42:32] conall: I found that comparison especially unflattering tbh. I don’t wear pink on any day, especially Wednesdays.

I’m enjoying the astrology link back and forth tbh. I seem to be winning in some way. Although that is what a prideful Leo would say
[19/09/2023, 21:44:00] conall: There’s probably a historical moment where having a small head was considered regal. Just think of yourself as the right aristocrat in the wrong time
[19/09/2023, 21:46:02] conall: Nah you’re not being dramatic honestly. Chronic illnesses are really shit so you’re bound to have the odd “fuck this I’m going to cry away from the non-existent baked potato stall” day, dw about it at all.

I was going to say “but I want to see your eyes like that” but then realised that sounds like I’m a serial killer
[19/09/2023, 21:46:29] conall: Yes! I’ve just got back. I’ll send you what I’ve been working on recently

[19/09/2023, 21:51:15] conall: Anyway what’ve you been doing with your evening? Enough of my ramblings, god I’ve sent you an essay there
[19/09/2023, 22:16:30] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I reallllyyyy want to know more about this situation especially as you’re literally going to Jesus Christ Superstar for her but realise this might be my nosey tendencies again so let’s park it
[19/09/2023, 22:17:41] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I will play this card next time Sophie tries to take me on, thank you 👑
[19/09/2023, 22:19:09] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Still can’t believe you thought spud-u-like still existed. That was a real throwback to walking round Debenhams with my mum on the weekends and trying to get her to buy me anything from Jane Nor so I’d have some cool points for school
[19/09/2023, 22:19:58] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This is so nice!!!
[19/09/2023, 22:20:45] Zoë “cringe” Turner: What will you use it for? We have so many in this house that are just kind of sitting and waiting for their fate
[19/09/2023, 22:21:54] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This is giving sting Ray or tadpole or some kind of water creature. I’ll need the back story eventually
[19/09/2023, 22:24:21] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I watched that Dispatches about Russel Brand the absolute creep, made lots of disgusted faces and then caught up with Ava on the phone while the cat hid from housemate’s boyfriend’s dog and did some weird contortions:
‎[19/09/2023, 22:24:36] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ‎<attached: 00000213-PHOTO-2023-09-19-22-24-36.jpg>
[19/09/2023, 22:24:44] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Imagine biting yourself that hard
[20/09/2023, 05:17:08] conall: Nah I’m happy to talk about anything, given the appropriate circumstances. It’s a long story I guess though, probably best for in person. Family chat in a tile shop sounds like my sort of Sunday. As a bonus I can give you my rundown of Jesus Christ Supperstar
[20/09/2023, 05:26:54] conall: Jane Nor didn’t ring any bells but I googled it (before you add it to the tally, I’m allowed because I’m not currently on a date) and the tote bags are bringing back a lot of memories. Very Y2K

Do you remember Joe Bloggs? I think it was a BHS thing, it’s basically all I ever got for my birthday’s. The lamp section was great too. They had tons of lights all turned on and it was very beguiling. RIP BHS
[20/09/2023, 05:29:34] conall: it’ll sit and await I think. Might give it to my Mum on Saturday, she’ll love it AND my new housemate told me that we need more plants because the pot to plant ratio in her place is already way off. Bit of a faux pas to make it worse on my first day there
[20/09/2023, 05:35:15] conall: I for one am SHOCKED at the Russel Brand news. He’s the last person that I’d ever imagine to be a creepy sex pest, I’m sure literally no one saw this coming

I need more details. Cats name, dogs name at least. More info required than that but it can wait. Also pic of said dog if you have one
[20/09/2023, 05:36:19] conall: It looks quite satisfying tbh
[20/09/2023, 05:37:51] conall: Update: just bit my shoulder. 3/10
[20/09/2023, 12:35:12] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Excited maybe isn’t the right word here….. fascinated? To hear more. Also: supperstar? I suppose he did have that really big famous supper one time. I admire your dedication to creating spin offs for absolutely everything
[20/09/2023, 12:38:15] Zoë “cringe” Turner: They were SUCH social leverage. Only the really cool girls carried their PE kit in a Jane Nor bag. I wasn’t one of them, until I got a reversible McKenzie jacket in the JD sports sale which seemed to make me some friends. Wasn’t school weird. I have no recollection of Joe Bloggs but I’ve just found out it was inspired by the Manchester club scene??? Did you feel a kinship to that culture age 12??
[20/09/2023, 12:40:45] Zoë “cringe” Turner: She’s probably hoping you’ll be supplier of said more plants but I feel like you should warn her that you can’t water them, even when someone leaves you reminders (or make sure you’re at least a few months into the contract before revealing this)
[20/09/2023, 12:44:28] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Lmao RIGHT? I certainly did not. 

The cat is called Moo, I think she’s got anxiety and wahs a lot but she’s very cute when not wahing. The dog is called Bruce, me and him are on tricky ground. Had an altercation when I was left alone with him for ten minutes wherein he wanted to play, he’s quite big and I don’t really know about or love dogs, didn’t know how to play, tried to ignore him and shower instead which he didn’t like and just kept barging the door down. But I got a lift to work with him in the car this morning and we seemed okay. Is that enough detail for now??
[20/09/2023, 12:45:02] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Only 3?! I think I’d get more satisfaction out of this personally
[20/09/2023, 14:38:39] conall: Everyone loves a spin off. Without them we wouldn’t have illustrious shows like Joey. I’m glad you’re excited to hear about my weird sister. I would say I want to hear about your weird family dynamics but you know, I’m just not that nosy. Although you did tell me about the PhD Mum thing.

Which reminds me, we barrelled onto something else but I meant to ask. What’re you thinking of doing a PhD in?
[20/09/2023, 14:44:56] conall: Hahahahah. Very funny thought you in a McKenzie jacket. Tiny head, big jacket is what I’m imagining

I know the exactly what you mean RE brand school weirdness. I hated the little strap bags because they just seemed shit, but after I got one (lost my other bag), I felt cooler and made a friend that I’m still friends with to this day. Very dumb.
[20/09/2023, 14:49:48] conall: oh I won’t be warning her, she seems competent enough. She doesn’t like cooking though, and I love it (but I am NOT a cooking guy as discussed).

I’ll cook, she’ll water the plants. Unsure if I’m getting a good deal here tbh
[20/09/2023, 15:01:00] conall: Great name for a cat. Funny to call an animal either a different animal or something a different animal does. Great bit.

It’s more detail than I asked for, but it has left me wanting even more. You’ve fed me a salty anecdote and now I need a watery story to hydrate myself (obligatory “I’ve been up since 4:30 AGAIN” situation today so my analogy game isn’t the best)
[20/09/2023, 15:01:21] conall: wait who’s shoulder you biting
[20/09/2023, 19:47:38] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I live for people’s weird family dynamics; it’s how we’re made. The PhD mum thing hahaha. Ugh, it was a kind of fleeting idea to do it in creative writing and use it as a really structured way to write, but I dunno, this is an idea I’ve had approx every 3 years and the application process just seems a bit MUCH
[20/09/2023, 19:51:03] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Wow well the McKenzie jacket was not supposed to make me a laughing stock !!!! Imagine if I still had it. What do you mean by little strap bags, I need to picture the thing that brought you and this person together
[20/09/2023, 19:55:33] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I think it’s maybe slightly funnier when animals are called things like Kevin or Sue. Never gets old. My friend used to have a really weird cat called Kevin and I’d just find him in the bath most mornings.

I’m enjoying the bad analogies, especially since we both know that I’m obsessed with hydrating - that water bottle? Actually just full of pet anecdotes. God I really wonder what 4.30 feels like
[20/09/2023, 19:56:55] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I did mean mine, realised it was ambiguous and carried on regardless
[20/09/2023, 20:04:11] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also did you know the new series of MAFS UK is out? A horse girl just called herself an animal whisperer and looks unsure about her match
[20/09/2023, 22:16:47] conall: Well you’ve struck a rich vein with my sister and I. Very odd situation that I would like to change but I have exhausted my options I think.

That does sound very fun, I’ve known people who’ve done PhD’s before and it seems to be really make or break. Some come out loving the subject and others come out hating it. Also you’re constantly fighting for grant money but I don’t know if you do that for creative writing, pens don’t cost much and they normally have paper you can steal from the printers. Do you think you’ll ever do it?
[20/09/2023, 22:18:04] conall: Some googling has told me that they’re actually called “gym sacks”, which is a very odd name to me but here is an example
‎[20/09/2023, 22:18:08] conall: ‎<attached: 00000238-PHOTO-2023-09-20-22-18-08.jpg>
[20/09/2023, 22:23:56] conall: Thanks for validating my analogies, you’re very understanding. I didn’t taste an anecdote when you gave me some water but I might have been distracted by trying not to spill it on myself, your bottle has a wide mouth that irked me on first use. I guess you want to get as much water in you as fast as possible
[20/09/2023, 22:27:23] conall: I didn’t know it was on, I think I’ve only watched the aussie one. Classic horse girl behaviour regardless. Does she whisper with all the animals Dr Doolittle style or just horses?

I’d say I’d watch it but if I’m not watching something with someone it’s no fun. Who’s going to listen to me say “bloody hell horse girls am I right”? The wall?
[20/09/2023, 22:30:20] conall: I had to cancel going to the pub quiz to attend a washing machine emergency at my sisters house. I’ll send a video of my handy work. I think you’ll find I’ve done a fantastic job
‎[20/09/2023, 22:30:40] conall: ‎<attached: 00000242-VIDEO-2023-09-20-22-30-40.mp4>
[21/09/2023, 10:07:42] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yeah, I feel like people doing them love to moan about doing them but you can also tell they’re very proud to have their thesis child. Unfortunately I do think you still have to ask for lots of money, if not for pens then just for the time to do it - I thought that as an employee of the Uni they’d cut me some benefits but it doesn’t seem to work like that 🫠 we will see
[21/09/2023, 10:10:39] Zoë “cringe” Turner: OH THESE. Yes. I think these are cool by way of being not a bag, like it’s the only way you can have a bag without it truly being a bag and therefore you’re nonchalant and don’t care about school, just football and Soulja Boy. I’m glad you got one in the end
[21/09/2023, 10:11:57] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I love that you kept this to yourself until now. Really laughing at the use of irked here for some reason. It’s literally not even that wide, have you ever drank from an Oasis bottle? Whoever is manufacturing those needs to fucking stop
[21/09/2023, 10:15:46] Zoë “cringe” Turner: She does ALL the animals, she had a sheep on a lead. And I mean, that’s kind of what I was doing last night, just making baffled sounds to myself while some guy who looks dead behind the eyes read ‘I love you’ from his vows to a stranger; hers were just ‘don’t speak to me before I’ve had my latte in the morning * death glare ‘. There’s no shame in the solo watch
[21/09/2023, 10:17:40] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Oh this is amazing. I assume the slow tilt is to make sure the washing liquid is all evenly spread around? Looks really effective, something I’ll consider having installed. 

Is this the sister that doesn’t hate you, and does she live here too??
[21/09/2023, 10:31:03] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ALSO: happy move day???? I think
[21/09/2023, 19:23:38] conall: Very lame system in the UK. Or I guess anywhere from my understanding. I wish more people could get some sort of “creative dole” that they could live on and just do what they liked. Maybe you’d have to show them what you did every 6 months or something. Seems only rich people ever get big at any sort of art, besides the few that sneak through the cracks
[21/09/2023, 19:25:41] conall: Great analysis of the bag, I agree completely. It’s useful for nothing really. It was really inconvenient and it hurt if you had anything remotely heavy in it. Pointless but it did give me street cred for one brief, fleeting moment
[21/09/2023, 19:27:24] conall: You haven’t seen my water bottle yet, thin mouth on that guy. I haven’t thought about Oasis in ages but last experience with it involved mixing vodka in there, then promptly spilling it down myself. I think I was wise to be cautious with your bottle
[21/09/2023, 19:32:11] conall: Sheep on a lead sounds like what a bad Korn cover band from the west country would play as there final song

Damn you’re really selling it, I might have to take a dip. It’s such a car crash
[21/09/2023, 19:35:06] conall: Thank you, I’ve really outdone myself here. This is the sister that doesn’t hate me (Niamh), Aoibhinn (the sister that hates me) wouldn’t ask me to do this even though she knows I could. She would see it as annoying that I am helping. A little taste of the dynamic there, an appetiser before the main course
[21/09/2023, 19:38:04] conall: thank you! It’s has been a death march and it’s not even done yet. I’ve  got all my stuff to the new place, it’s taken so much longer than I ever thought it would.

Had a break to eat some tibetan kitchen, now I need to make a bed frame, assemble about 5 bits of ikea furniture, and build my desk. Not enjoying this BUT the flat is nice and I’m very glad to have moved.

How’s your day / afternoon / night gone / going / not happened yet (delete as appropriate)

[21/09/2023, 21:08:04] Zoë “cringe” Turner: False shamrock = straight on the window ledge, as it should be. PLEASE tell me you’re making the bed first so that you’re not about to sleep on that hard wood floor (or I guess on the sofa you presumably have). Very glad you feel good about the move, it’s a great feeling escaping from a not ideal living situation, I have experienced the same relief probably too many times. Also a break to eat Tibetan kitchen is maybe the most Chorltonesque thing I’ve ever heard
[21/09/2023, 21:08:42] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I hope you manage to slog through the rest of it soon 🙏 sending moving prayers
[21/09/2023, 21:12:23] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I don’t think it would’ve been the end of the world if you’d spilt anything on yourself via my weird bottle. I would’ve just laughed and then apologised like your ineptitude was my fault
[21/09/2023, 21:15:55] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Had to google how to pronounce Aoibhinn in very typical English fashion just now. This is tantalising info. Also; for ‘not a cooking guy, just a guy who cooks’ you’re really going hard with the foodie analogies
[21/09/2023, 21:19:58] Zoë “cringe” Turner: My day / night / week is so dull cause I just keep getting re-ill. I was supposed to be working the late tonight but everyone kept telling me how awful I looked and then I had to leave the new coordinator by himself which I’m feeling bad about. He had lots of other staff in and has worked in the gallery for about 9 years so I’m hoping this is fine and there have been no fires, he would likely do a better job than me even if there were
[21/09/2023, 21:21:10] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hoping my life returns to more exciting pastures soon
[21/09/2023, 22:13:52] conall: Speaking of false shamrocks, had some fennel recently. No idea where it’ll go on the chart. It’s completely thrown me, suggestions pls

I know its very cliche isn’t it. Glad to
be chatting to a salt-of-the-earth Gortonite (Gortie? Gortonian?), it’s helping me stay in touch with my roots. Really appreciate it
[21/09/2023, 22:15:02] conall: Thanks, appreciate that. I’ve bought the right bookshelf but the wrong shelves. It doesn’t fit together. I thought Ikea was idiot proof! I DO love assembling flat pack furniture though, it’s my calling
[21/09/2023, 22:19:41] conall: Damn I should’ve asked you in person, always like hearing what people think it sounds like. I go hard with all analogies, not just food ones. My analogies go like a boiled egg, or a turmeric root, or bit of parmesan
[21/09/2023, 22:28:39] conall: Ah that’s really shite. The sinusitis thing still? I wish I could say something more poignant and caring but the only thing I can think is “I hope you feel better and this sounds very bad”
[21/09/2023, 22:35:42] conall: ALSO big moves happening on top of the move today
‎[21/09/2023, 22:36:05] conall: ‎<attached: 00000267-PHOTO-2023-09-21-22-36-05.jpg>
[21/09/2023, 22:37:35] conall: Kate is a MAFSUK watcher, I am onboard. 3rd ep. Unsure which one horse girl is
[22/09/2023, 09:48:26] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Is fennel that aniseedy one that goes really well with sausages? Hmm. Maybe with FS but like two points to the right, just slightly closer to sweet? 

Hahaha - do you think Gorton possibly has Blackpool vibes, is that what you’re getting at here? I’d love to compare the goings on of Big Tesco Gorton to Big Tesco (or equivalent) Blackpool.
[22/09/2023, 09:52:35] Zoë “cringe” Turner: WHAT. Don’t they simply just come with the shelves??? That would 100% be my assumption. The last time I put together anything from IKEA I had quite an awkward flatmate who just kind of watched me struggling to put it together with one pair of hands  instead of offering hers, which I found quite funny. It forced me to fulfil my potential at least
[22/09/2023, 09:55:36] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Sorry, I can’t unsee the two quite easy syllables it actually is, but wish I could for the bit
[22/09/2023, 09:58:48] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I think so!! Might be a weird combo of things. But THANKS I am fine I just need the rest but it’s boring. What do you do in this situation?? Not quite functioning highly enough but not without restlessness? I might try and read an entire book today
[22/09/2023, 10:02:04] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Omg. I have this one to catch up on. Okay technically she was more of a well-rounded farm girl but I went with horse for the sake of the call back. I can’t wait to find out why two of them were shouting at each other on the beach !!!
[22/09/2023, 12:51:30] conall: Unsure of your qualifications to say this actually, to my knowledge you haven’t eaten a leaf of your FS like some, more committed, botanists you may know

I feel like it does. People do the same face when you say “oh they’re from Gorton” or “oh I’m from Blackpool”. I would like to see the Tesco. I have a good people watching game I used to play in airports when I had to travel a lot, it’s called “would I wear that t shirt” (often the answer is no)
[22/09/2023, 12:54:41] conall: The shelf sides (posts) are separate from the actual shelf bits. Clearly my spacial reasoning is quite poor. I am back at Ikea now, very bleak situation.

I think I would enjoy seeing you assemble flatpack furniture. I don’t know why I just have an image in my head of it being quite funny. Not enough hands, McKenzie coat getting in the way, water spilling everywhere from your outrageous bottle
[22/09/2023, 13:02:56] conall: That’s a bummer. It’s almost better being fully ill so you can really commit to vegging out. I hope you feel better soon, it must really suck being ill for this long

I can’t really suggest anything because I am not a good ill person. If I get a bit ill I continue on until I get very ill, then I try to continue until someone who cares about me tells me to go to bed. Not a model I would recommend
[22/09/2023, 13:03:40] conall: What’s your illness strategy? Read a big book? Watch a horse girl shout? Go to big tesco?
[22/09/2023, 13:06:01] conall: Thank you for the callback, I do enjoy the fact you did that. However it put me in an awkward spot yesterday because I kept chatting about this horse girl and Kate was confused as to who I meant. She also hadn’t seen the sheep on a lead. It’s like she’s watching a totally different show
‎[22/09/2023, 13:15:37] conall: ‎<attached: 00000279-PHOTO-2023-09-22-13-15-37.jpg>
[22/09/2023, 17:33:16] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I don’t know if this was some sort of dare but I rose to it either way. I was quite surprised by the sharp undertones??? But I did pick the flower that looked like it was dying, so maybe that was just sour death. Did you go stem or petal? I did a bit of both for a well rounded experience. Hope I’ve proved myself as worthy to stay on the project 

An EXCELLENT game, I want to play. Your dismissal of so many T-shirts doesn’t surprise me considering one of the first things you told me about yourself is that you’re known for consistently wearing white T-shirts. Also: someone at work told me yesterday about a new, similar game, called ‘hard or soft’ where they just point at things and you have to guess which it is
‎[22/09/2023, 17:34:02] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ‎<attached: 00000281-PHOTO-2023-09-22-17-34-02.jpg>
[22/09/2023, 17:38:22] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m amazed that this is the picture I’ve managed to build of myself in such a short space of time. She sounds effortless, stylish AND unflappable.
[22/09/2023, 17:44:24] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Well okay, I certainly won’t be taking any further ill advice from yourself. Are you ill right now and just pretending you’re not?? Letting me dramatise my own circumstances when someone should definitely be taking you to a walk in?? 

My strategy today has been nap, read, eat, repeat and I’ve decided I’m going to be better tomorrow for the sake of someone’s birthday I have just missed. I’ve also made that fermented garlic honey for prevention purposes - gonna have to think of all the most inventive ways to eat it when it’s done
[22/09/2023, 17:46:58] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahahahaha. I’m so sorry about this. Hope I didn’t make your first night there too awkward. The sheep on a lead was absolutely a thing but this proves my theory that nobody actually watches an entire episode of that show without taking their eyes off the screen; there’s got to be a secondary distraction otherwise it’s actually a bit too much to process
[22/09/2023, 17:49:11] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This seems so obvious when they’re lying side by side. But I can say that from over here, I wasn’t there in the heat of the moment. IKEA is an overwhelming place, you’ve done well to turn it around so quickly
[22/09/2023, 23:12:13] conall: Zoë I can’t say how much it means to me that you put your tastebuds on the line for this project. You’re a natural. I didn’t expect you to go the distance but consider yourself a founding member of the team. Who needs that PhD anyway

ALSO very happy that you’re into “would I wear that t-shirt”, it’s been a fave of mine for years now. Very pleased to bring someone else into the fold. I wonder if Blackpool Tesco will yield better t-shirts than Gorton? Exciting research ahead.

As a side note, I drove through Gorton today and passed the big Tesco on my way to my storage unit. It is a very big Tesco
[22/09/2023, 23:14:33] conall: Yes but if I purchased it, it would be initially as a bit, then I would realise that I look quite silly and not in the way I’m going for. Example: my Katy Perry US Tour t-shirt. It’s just pjs now

You should’ve bought this t-shirt though
[22/09/2023, 23:17:40] conall: I’ve probably laughed for about 5 minutes now at the word unflappable

Also autocorrect / type suggestion thing informs me that “unflappability” is a word. What a time to be alive
[22/09/2023, 23:22:44] conall: I am a bit ill but it’s mostly just the build up of about 3 weeks waking up at 5am. My sleep is very fucked atm and I really don’t know what to do about it. I’m in the process of signing up to the GP and I’ll go when I return from Parish

Good plan, I hope you’re feeling better - I’ve said that a lot, I need better cliches. The birthday thing confuses me but I am tired and two pints tipsy. I’m sure you make sense, you use words better than me. Please explain what fermented garlic honey is, it sounds fantastic
[22/09/2023, 23:28:00] conall: You’re very correct. I don’t think we watched it at all and two episodes went by (although another friend threw rocks at the window, I may have said this already). The will is there to get into it and you’ve been very accommodating with my hobbies (eating plants), it’s only fair to return the favour
[22/09/2023, 23:34:10] conall: I can’t ramble too much about this ikea trip because a) boring b) long c) still reeling due to excessive tiredness but just know I have a new “bad retail” anecdote. I may keep it in my water bottle
[23/09/2023, 13:51:19] Zoë “cringe” Turner: 🫡 thrilled to be on board - we can talk pay rises etc etc further down the line. 

OH. In that case you’ve basically seen Gorton. I live opposite big Tesco just a few rows back. I’m gonna start playing the game by myself next time I’m in there, and will feedback. Maybe you can do the same when you’re passing through Blackpool? Then we’ll have a sense of the playing field
[23/09/2023, 13:54:28] Zoë “cringe” Turner: My main question here is: were you at the Katy Perry US tour? I decided this tshirt was too much money for the bit, I knew it would end up in loungewear territory or there was a risk people would think I was being serious if I wore it to the shop.
[23/09/2023, 13:58:08] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahaha - incredible that it’s a real word. One can simply NOT be flapped (though in all seriousness it’s not a word I would use to describe myself)
[23/09/2023, 14:04:23] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I mean yeah I would feel rundown from this experience also, plus you’ve just moved house, which people love telling me is the MOST STRESSFUL THING A PERSON CAN DO but I’m not sure how accurate that is anymore, the amount we tend to do it. Unless we’ve just adapted to a certain level of cortisol who knows. But good idea - Parish might also knock you out for about 48 hours afterwards and you’ll perhaps be reborn 

As far as cliches go it’s probably the most appropriate. I’m getting better I think thank you!! Yeah no it didn’t make sense the way I wrote it, that was on me, it was my best mates birthday yesterday and I missed it to sleep more, so I’m going to go see him now. I hope you enjoyed the tipsiness and can have a restful Saturday??
[23/09/2023, 14:05:29] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I hate the be that person who’s like ‘we spoke about this!!!’ But I did tell you about fermented garlic honey the other day and then you told me that people have to ‘burp’ stuff they ferment and I thought you meant into it & then we moved on which was for the best
[23/09/2023, 14:07:39] Zoë “cringe” Turner: What time are you free tomorrow?? I will need to know more about a) your rock throwing friend and b) the bad ikea experience
[23/09/2023, 19:11:25] conall: I’ll put you in touch with your union rep.

Oh fantastic. Please let me know, we should probably work out some sort of format to specify how good the t shirts are. It’s all been in my head so far. I feel like Gorton might win but you always put the place you’re from down a bit don’t you
[23/09/2023, 19:12:34] conall: I was not. Unlike you I committed to the bit, it was a poor decision though. It’s a comfy t shirt, not a total loss. I think you made the right move but I am a bit disappointed I won’t ever see you in it
[23/09/2023, 19:16:24] conall: I got halfway through drawing a flappability scale, you were on one end but I couldn’t think of anything funny to put on anywhere else. I had an idea about Condors but couldn’t work it out properly. I think my brain is slow due to the combo of Jesus Christ Superstar, 2 pints and a lot of indian food. You can just imagine I made something funny though
[23/09/2023, 19:21:13] conall: I can inform you moving is STILL stressful. My brain is in a constant state of disorganisation and a thing that helps is having a physical space that isn’t. Now the physical space isn’t either so it’s all gone to pot. It will be done in a few hours though. Tonight is the last big push

VERY glad you’re feeling better. Hope you enjoying seeing your mate this eve. I’m not doing much tonight, just sorting out the last four boxes of my life and putting up a load of art. I am very bad at hanging pictures as it turns out
[23/09/2023, 19:22:45] conall: Oh dear, I’m sorry to make you that person. I do remember this now. Our conversations in person have been very fun and covered a lot of ground. I think that’s why it slipped through. I’d like to try some of this honey, it sound divine. Can I buy it anywhere or is this a homemade speciality?
[23/09/2023, 19:25:22] conall: right you’re going to think I’m obsessed with Ikea but I have to go back there tomorrow. Me and my sister are going, I thought I had curtains in my unit but I only have one, she also needs Ikea things.

I’ll be done at probably 11:30/12. If you want to meet straight after that I can get her to drop me in Levvie, or I can head back to Chorlton and bus it back later. What time are you available?
[23/09/2023, 19:26:40] conall: LASTLY I was listening to Nick Cave on Friday because I haven’t really listened to him much except the big stuff. I was also reading his wikipedia page, his birthday was yesterday! I meant to say this, I can’t remember why I didn’t
[23/09/2023, 20:41:43] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m gonna start with the old fashioned notes app, a description of the tshirt and just a Y/N next to it and we can build from there?? What do you think. I know you love a graph but with the sweet potato already ongoing and you having tried to introduce a flappability scale today, I fear overwhelm
[23/09/2023, 20:43:25] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I think you’re braver than me for buying the tshirt Conall. I am also disappointed in myself. I wonder if it’s still in the shop…
[23/09/2023, 20:48:06] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Oh I know the feeling exactly and this explains why you’ve been rushing back and forth to Ikea for the right size shelf things/curtains you don’t have - I also cannot leave something like this unfinished and just have to resolve it by any means necessary before I can move on. I hope you get it all sorted tonight so it can start to feel like normal!! Send art pics
[23/09/2023, 20:51:53] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m glad this is the reason you’ve forgotten hahaha, I don’t disagree. You quite literally just peel a load of garlic cloves and cover them in honey and wait for them to do their thing for a bit I guess?! I’m waiting for bubbles to appear. I think I was supposed to use nice raw honey, not the Stockwell tesco brand but honey’s honey init
[23/09/2023, 20:56:16] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m available whenever so whatever is easiest for you - I dunno if you’ll wanna go back to yours with whatever you get from Ikea trip no.43 first? Just let me know, I’m only a 10 minute cycle away. Also if you don’t get a lift please don’t attempt to get a bus from Chorlton to Levy it won’t work; get the 5 min train from Piccadilly or cycle down the loop, it’s like a 25 min ride or something
[23/09/2023, 20:59:49] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Was it?! I still follow his wife on Instagram for some reason so probably knew this somewhere in my brain. I’m a weird kind of fan of his, I mainly admire the way he thinks and tells stories, and whenever I’ve seen him I’ve felt like I’m having some kind of spiritual experience. He made a really good film 20,000 Days on Earth and I didn’t stop thinking about it for a long time
[23/09/2023, 21:00:24] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I wonder whether Jesus Christ Superstar was a spiritual experience for you. Looking forward to hearing about it
[23/09/2023, 21:59:13] conall: No that’s fine. I admire your cavalier attitude to this. I DO like a graph but only if it’s silly. If we had a system for this it would likely be a google sheet or something and how are we going to make that fun? Colour the cells? Make a “crazy” formula that adds up all of our scores and averages them? Ridiculous. Thank you for keeping me in line
[23/09/2023, 21:59:45] conall: A) is the shop in Levvie
B) can we go tomorrow
[23/09/2023, 22:00:40] conall: I’m the same. It’s annoying me even more now I’m so close to a fantastic cozy room. I can taste it (cooking analogy #54)
[23/09/2023, 22:01:19] conall: I will send art pictures but I have been told by both nice and mean sisters that my bed needs rotating. I will maybe do this tonight but I have to get some satsumas first
[23/09/2023, 22:02:18] conall: Honey IS honey. This sounds very fun. I’ve never fermented anything, I’d like to do it. I have more questions but I won’t ask them because I have probably already asked them and forgotten the answer
‎[23/09/2023, 22:02:58] conall: ‎<attached: 00000317-PHOTO-2023-09-23-22-02-58.jpg>
[23/09/2023, 22:03:39] conall: what on EARTH is going on in east manc. Why do they want to keep everyone out. What are you up to over there
[23/09/2023, 22:05:02] conall: I will let you know the plans tomorrow, I might need to go back home because I’ll have curtains and the like. I won’t put them up or anything I’ll just drop them off then decide which bad form of transport I would like to take to see you. I’d bike it but I’m saving my legs (very lame I know)
[23/09/2023, 22:07:36] conall: It was! I enjoyed what I listened to. I thought “oh this guy loves Leonard Cohen” then read his wikipedia page and he says on it “I love Leonard Cohen”. I felt like such a worldly individual.

I like that you follow his wife, and not him. I guess maybe he doesn’t have an account but I’m going to choose to believe he does and you just like getting second hand info. You’ve sold me on him though. I love Leonard Cohen so I think I’ll really like him. Thanks for the recommendation / getting a Ned Flanders tattoo
[23/09/2023, 22:08:15] conall: We already have such a docket for conversation tomorrow. PLUS the tiles. This is going to be quite the day. I’m excited
[24/09/2023, 10:14:29] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I think I would prefer this, not because I don’t want to help you carry curtains around, but because I’m still on the go slow (in my healing era) so a bit later would be better anyway!! Lemme know ETA when you know - I am once again sorry about where I live x
[24/09/2023, 10:15:24] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It’s not 😭😭😭😭 I’ve really ruined this for myself
[24/09/2023, 10:44:21] conall: Hey, long story but didn't go to Ikea in the end. Spent the morning picking up glass, I'll explain when I see you. Hopefully Kate has got pics
[24/09/2023, 10:44:57] conall: Anyway I just need to get some food in me, get a shower then I'll be good to head down to levs. I think the earliest I could get there is 1ish?
[24/09/2023, 11:01:28] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Oh???? Interesting I hope everything’s okay
‎[24/09/2023, 11:02:10] conall: ‎<attached: 00000327-PHOTO-2023-09-24-11-02-10.jpg>
[24/09/2023, 11:03:29] conall: this is what she sent me this morning, we had to smash it up into bits to take it outside. Took bloody yonks and I may have glass in my hand (idiotic)

Is 1pm alright for you or do you fancy later?
[24/09/2023, 11:09:31] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Has there been an isolated earthquake in your living room?? I’m so confused / please get the glass out of your hand
[24/09/2023, 11:14:25] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Right so I feel like a let down & irked because I wanted to see you again before you go on your tower adventures but I’m super up and down and not feeling like myself so I feel like I probably shouldn’t push it today - even seeing Ryan last night was a bit of a slog, I’m really sorry to do this last minute 😔 I know we had a whole docket, and I had never heard or seen that word before
[24/09/2023, 12:28:19] conall: No need to apologise honestly. I was looking forward to seeing you, but I wouldn’t want to drag you out if you’re feeling like crap. I can head back to Blackpool tonight anyway now so it’s not a total loss

I’m back from Paris next Tuesday, let me know if you fancy a catch up later on that week. Sadly I haven’t had the time to research better cliches, but I DO hope you get better soon

P.S. Glad to have introduced the word docket
[24/09/2023, 12:34:35] conall: It just shattered early this morning, no reason as to why. Maybe the rock throwing friend threw rocks again. Also the glass in my hand has not been removed as yet, I may need to go to A&E. Tweezers have not helped. In hindsight this date was doomed from both ends
[24/09/2023, 13:19:42] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I hope you have the most amazing time / stay safe and of course hydrated. Are you setting off first thing and can I still receive minor updates as and when they’re available?? I’ll just be here possibly figuring out a tshirt spreadsheet depending on how many compelling ones I see, you really blew my notes app idea out of the water with that one 

How about the Friday? Surely we’ll both be healthy, sane and sans glass by then. On a separate note I really hope you don’t need to go to A&E but if you do, hope you’re not waiting a ridiculously long time. Today is cursed! The table knew it from the beginning
[24/09/2023, 13:26:10] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also on this: the Push the Sky Away album could actually be great a&e listening, if worst comes to worst. He obviously doesn’t have Instagram, like any cultural icon with integrity. I haven’t listened to Leonard Cohen for a long time, any reccs appreciated
[24/09/2023, 14:53:49] conall: Aw thanks, I’ll deffo send some updates through. I’ll be stopping once or twice each day, then at the end obv. I’ll stay in touch so you know I’m not in a ditch somewhere. I am a bit worried because 3 airbnbs have cancelled in Stoke tomorrow. Need to find a place to stay pronto.

Good luck with the t shirt collection. I’ve got great faith in your skills. You’ve really shown your dedication with FS-Gate.

I think I’ll be fine, it is still in my hand but I think my body will just reject it. It’s happened with a splinter before and it took a week to come out. This is a little bit bigger but it’ll be fine.

Today IS cursed. Kate was meant to be on a date too, they just cancelled. So we’re assembling yet MORE ikea furniture and I’m trying to convince her that the guy actually does like her (his texts make it obvious that he does but she doesn’t think so)

How’s your day going? Got any plans other than checking your fermentation for bubbles, reading, sleeping?
[24/09/2023, 14:58:05] conall: If I can find my headphones I’ll give it a listen on my way home. Being on a train with glass in your hand is close to the A&E experience anyway, I think it’ll suit. “Various Positions” is probably his most accessible album I’d say. It’s got some silly tunes on it but it’s always what I recommend first
[24/09/2023, 16:03:42] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I appreciate being on the ‘hi I’m not in a ditch’ list. Have you tried looking for places a bit outside of Stoke, like Leek or Crewe? I don’t know how far off track that would take you but it might be more likely that they don’t bail. I’m actually going home tomorrow evening, so if you end up with one option and it’s the street do let me know and I can try and do something about it
[24/09/2023, 16:07:09] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m unsure about your hand to glass logic but if this is what you’re manifesting then yes fine I guess it will just jump out eventually. And oh bless her!! What’s wrong with us all today, maybe people shouldn’t date on Sundays. Now I’m a bit worried she had to do the same for you but I’m doubtful
[24/09/2023, 16:10:01] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m actually doing some freelance stuff to try and feel a bit more normal and it’s WORKING. That’s a bit sad isn’t it but it’s digging me out of a hole. I’m glad because I have to get a tattoo tomorrow morning that I’ve already cancelled once and I think at this point he would just keep all my money and not see me if I tried to do that again
[24/09/2023, 16:14:35] Zoë “cringe” Turner: These songs are so nice! I had forgotten. Also searching for him reminded me that that band I was banging on about when you were asking about my tshirt the other night (Boygenius) have a song called Leonard Cohen and it’s very good
[24/09/2023, 18:41:41] conall: It's getting to be quite a long list, I hope that doesn't dilute your appreciation. Very kind of you to offer but I've managed to find a place in Little Bridgeford, I think it's south of Stoke but unsure how long away. Any tips for places to eat? Funny that we'll be there at the same time. What're you going home for?
[24/09/2023, 18:46:49] conall: It's already poking out a bit! I think by tomorrow I'll be able to get a grip on it. Also I forgot to say, yes Friday 6th October is great for me. We're testing the loading capacity of the docket to it's very limits. I'll have a think of something fun we can do when I'm slogging myself across the country this week
[24/09/2023, 18:47:53] conall: wahey! Glad you're feeling a little better. Sometimes you just need to feel like you're productive and that jump starts you. What tattoo you getting? I hope it's as good as the serenity prayer
[24/09/2023, 18:52:27] conall: Glad you enjoyed, I'll have to give Boygenius a spin at some point. I've been organising my stuff for the trip for the past hour or two and I've had Push the Sky Away on the whole time, I think it's played about 3 times now. I really love it, thanks for telling me about it. There's about 3 songs on there that are incredible, I don't know the names but I'll work out what they are in time for when we see each other again

[24/09/2023, 19:17:46] Zoë “cringe” Turner: You’re super close to Stafford as well, which is a slightly bigger town but it’s been a bit rundown the last few years and I’m not sure where’s good anymore
[24/09/2023, 19:20:27] conall: let’s DO IT
[24/09/2023, 19:20:44] conall: I was going to suggest this also, but assumed you were gonna be doing family stuff / busy
[24/09/2023, 19:21:14] conall: I’ve got nothing on all night other than staying with my airbnb host lady so I’d be glad to get out and see the sights
[24/09/2023, 19:21:31] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahaha okay great
[24/09/2023, 19:21:59] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I am just seeing my family but I’ll be there for a few nights
[24/09/2023, 19:22:21] conall: they say you shouldn’t travel too far for a third date, what do they know
[24/09/2023, 19:23:01] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Do they say that? I’ve never heard anyone say that
[24/09/2023, 19:23:32] conall: look I didn’t expect to be called out okay
[24/09/2023, 19:23:41] conall: I thought I could slip that by
[24/09/2023, 19:25:48] Zoë “cringe” Turner: What time are you anticipating being in the general area?? Because I could either a) get the train straight to Stone and meet you there or b) go home first and then walk/get a lift to swynnerton (character reveal: I don’t drive)
[24/09/2023, 19:26:15] conall: I’m going to set off about 7ish
[24/09/2023, 19:26:18] conall: am*
[24/09/2023, 19:26:33] conall: it’s 150km, and I’ll be doing about 25km per hour on average
[24/09/2023, 19:26:43] conall: I’ll make about 2/3 stops for 30ish mins each
[24/09/2023, 19:26:48] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Tbh could also get a lift to stone later
[24/09/2023, 19:26:52] conall: fuck this is just a GCSE maths question isn’t it
[24/09/2023, 19:26:56] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m sure someone would do that for me
[24/09/2023, 19:27:00] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yeah please no maths
[24/09/2023, 19:27:24] conall: okay
[24/09/2023, 19:27:26] conall: very roughly
[24/09/2023, 19:27:51] conall: like, 8 hours after 7am
[24/09/2023, 19:28:05] conall: 3/4pm
[24/09/2023, 19:28:24] conall: I can share my location if that’s not too weird, you’ll at least know when I’m nearish then
[24/09/2023, 19:29:13] conall: actually, I forget you’ve got a nosy streak. Maybe you’d enjoy the location thing
[24/09/2023, 19:29:32] conall: That’s the ultimate nosy trove
[24/09/2023, 19:30:00] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Do you wanna meet me in stone around then before you go to the bnb?? Is that easiest? Cause I can do that, will just get the train there
[24/09/2023, 19:30:20] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This whole thing is a bit weird already I think
[24/09/2023, 19:31:50] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I cancelled today just to intervene on your sojourn to my hometown instead
[24/09/2023, 19:32:16] Zoë “cringe” Turner: That is the most nosey thing I’ve ever heard
[24/09/2023, 19:33:41] conall: it’s not weird, it’s just a good bit. That’s what I’m telling myself
[24/09/2023, 19:34:01] conall: speaking of good bits, I can’t wear nice t shirts on this trip so I brought the Katy Perry one
[24/09/2023, 19:34:24] conall: I’ll share my location tomorrow morning on find my friends or something. Might as well commit to this bit
[24/09/2023, 19:35:35] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I think I saw it in the pile but didn’t wanna ask
[24/09/2023, 19:35:52] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Okay we’ll go with that
[24/09/2023, 19:36:14] Zoë “cringe” Turner: COMMITTING. This at least takes the pressure off that overflowing docket
[24/09/2023, 19:36:42] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Stone is a bit odd by the way
[24/09/2023, 19:38:06] conall: I can’t wait to see it

[24/09/2023, 19:57:30] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I feel like I’m about to watch you compete in Race Across the World
[24/09/2023, 19:58:52] conall: me and my sister were going to enter that
[24/09/2023, 19:59:00] conall: but we realised we don’t have enough of an angle
[24/09/2023, 19:59:08] conall: we’d have to pretend to be estranged or something
[24/09/2023, 19:59:17] conall: the one who likes me*
[24/09/2023, 19:59:34] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Well
[24/09/2023, 19:59:36] conall: I would have a good angle with the one who doesn’t like me, but obviously, she doesn’t like me
[24/09/2023, 19:59:47] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Do you know which sister you would have an angle with?
[24/09/2023, 19:59:57] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ^ you do know
[24/09/2023, 20:00:08] conall: She would never agree to it
[24/09/2023, 20:00:15] conall: and likely admonish me for suggesting it
[24/09/2023, 20:00:38] conall: in fact she might be the only admonisher I have in my life. I barely get admonished at all
[24/09/2023, 20:00:50] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I think you could apply and then get the show to coerce her into it
[24/09/2023, 20:01:15] conall: I bet the producers are good at that too
[24/09/2023, 20:01:41] Zoë “cringe” Turner: you’re still feeding me these breadcrumb trails and no real story
[24/09/2023, 20:02:02] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Oh yeah 100% coercive is in their essential criteria
[24/09/2023, 20:02:29] conall: I know and I love it
[24/09/2023, 20:02:48] conall: it’s like that story of the blind person feeling an elephant
[24/09/2023, 20:04:08] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I don’t think I know that story
[24/09/2023, 20:04:16] Zoë “cringe” Turner: But it’s not the one I want to know
[24/09/2023, 20:04:42] conall: I’ve always respected your honesty
[24/09/2023, 20:08:51] conall: not to be that public transport moaning guy
[24/09/2023, 20:09:09] conall: in fact, no I won’t be that guy. Very dull. Train bad, that’s all
[24/09/2023, 20:14:22] Zoë “cringe” Turner: that’s okay we’re all this guy, is it a northern train
[24/09/2023, 20:14:45] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Is everyone annoyed at you for having a bike
[24/09/2023, 20:15:31] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Drunk men shout at me often when I try and take my bike on trains in town
[24/09/2023, 20:17:06] conall: yes which is extra annoying. Northern stuff is GOOD cos I like being ironically parochial
[24/09/2023, 20:17:18] conall: no less than 4 people have said I can’t bring it on here
[24/09/2023, 20:17:31] conall: it is in a very bad spot, but I have no other options

[24/09/2023, 20:33:51] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Lmao I understand
[24/09/2023, 20:34:18] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This is fine! You just need to do the awkward lean across the whole carriage every time a person wants to get off
[24/09/2023, 20:34:20] Zoë “cringe” Turner: No problem
[24/09/2023, 20:47:35] conall: very true. I do think it’s funny when people act like I’m doing this on purpose to be annoying for some reason
[24/09/2023, 20:48:26] conall: you’ve really given me a strong urge to watch Race Across the World
[24/09/2023, 20:55:14] Zoë “cringe” Turner: You’re going to your mum and dads right?? What else is there to do there
[24/09/2023, 20:55:27] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I believe there’s a celeb version on right now, but they’re never as good
[24/09/2023, 21:00:41] conall: there is scones I hear
[24/09/2023, 21:00:58] conall: also I’ll be there at 9:35, not really Scone O’Clock is it
[24/09/2023, 21:02:01] conall: I might give that a spin on my phone in bed, although I AM reading a fun book atm. What’re you reading atm? (very sorry if you’ve already told me)
[24/09/2023, 21:05:29] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I would counter that scones are so versatile as to be appropriate at 9.35pm. Warm, butter, basically toast. Parents are obsessed with scones aren’t they?? Were they big in the 60s
[24/09/2023, 21:07:53] Zoë “cringe” Turner: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57793383

I’m reading this, it’s interesting but I’m not hooked. The vibe is a bit ‘the white book’ if you ever read that
[24/09/2023, 21:08:31] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Are you still reading about old art ???
[24/09/2023, 21:09:02] Zoë “cringe” Turner: (Non derogative)
[24/09/2023, 21:11:44] conall: might start putting this at the end of all my texts
[24/09/2023, 21:12:23] conall: they are and mine LOVE them because they can put no sugar in and then say “wow they taste great, who needs sugar, this is so healthy!”. It never gets old I love it
[24/09/2023, 21:12:59] conall: Never heard of the white book, or this book for that matter. Add it to the docket!
[24/09/2023, 21:14:34] conall: I have mostly finished that, I am an art expert now. I forgot to load up my kindle with books before I left, so just started reading Lord of the flies cos it happened to be on there. It’s quite fun. I guess I should’ve read it by this point but there’s too many “classics” to get through
[24/09/2023, 21:25:03] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Will you just not include it when you’re actively trying to be mean or will you confirm derogative intentions
[24/09/2023, 21:25:39] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahahaaha this is so cute, I bet they try and give you loads to take with you as well
[24/09/2023, 21:26:41] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Oh my god WHAT. Did you never read this in school???!! My imagination is still scarred, you’re in for a weird ride there. I’m trying to remember plot points but all I can see is a dead pig
[24/09/2023, 21:26:59] Zoë “cringe” Turner: In fact maybe a boy was called piggie and he was dead
[24/09/2023, 21:27:09] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Sorry that was possibly a spoiler
[24/09/2023, 21:27:14] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Don’t read into it

[24/09/2023, 21:52:33] conall: hmmm unsure. I am very very rarely trying to be mean
[24/09/2023, 21:52:52] conall: i know! i know!
[24/09/2023, 21:53:07] conall: thanks for the spoiler, just been introduced to piggy
[24/09/2023, 21:53:20] conall: although tbf he seems like such a sad sack it’s obvious he’s the one who’s gonna die
[24/09/2023, 21:53:34] conall: it WAS?!
[24/09/2023, 21:53:47] conall: tbf it’s like a million years old
[24/09/2023, 21:53:49] conall: more fool me
[24/09/2023, 21:53:54] conall: i like this

[24/09/2023, 22:11:14] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Sorry, I am notoriously bad for this. I think it’s because I don’t mind spoilers so just assume everyone else will be okay but people get so mad, rightly so. It’s like when someone makes a cup of tea for you the way they have theirs just cause that’s the way they have it (I would NEVER do this)
[24/09/2023, 22:12:47] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yes one of my eyes will be the grim reaper’s and the other will be the mask’s
[24/09/2023, 22:13:22] Zoë “cringe” Turner: no it’s going on the opposite arm to the other one to make them like book ends
[24/09/2023, 22:13:43] Zoë “cringe” Turner: The epitome of health!
[24/09/2023, 22:14:42] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I just meditated and I think my phone counteracts the results so bye for now, good luck on your first stretch and see you in Stone for some reason
[24/09/2023, 22:19:05] conall: Nah I’m the same, couldn’t care less about a spoiler tbh. I like seeing how we get there anyway ALSO I don’t drink tea
[24/09/2023, 22:19:17] conall: I LOVE this
[24/09/2023, 22:19:23] conall: you’re gonna be like a bookcase
[24/09/2023, 22:19:26] conall: great bit
[24/09/2023, 22:20:59] conall: very nice work. I look forward to hurling myself down the A6. We’ll sort out specifics tomorrow
[25/09/2023, 07:33:31] conall: started. Shared my location (weird or bit? who knows). Enjoy the tatt
[25/09/2023, 08:17:40] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Right now it looks like you’re making a pitstop at bargain booze, this is great fun
[25/09/2023, 12:09:43] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ETA still 3ish?
[25/09/2023, 12:16:11] conall: I’d probably say closer to 4 to be safe
[25/09/2023, 12:16:51] conall: I’ve got 10k left of this leg, then I’m gonna find some lunch, then I’ve got another 40k before I’m in Stone
[25/09/2023, 12:17:12] conall: so far it’s been about 3 1/2 hours per 50k
[25/09/2023, 12:20:32] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Ok I’ll get the train that gets me in at 15.33 cause they’re only every hour, I don’t mind hanging around doing nothing, I perfected it there
[25/09/2023, 12:23:40] conall: fantastic
[25/09/2023, 12:24:24] conall: Let me know where you fancy meeting and I’ll set my little GPS for there when I get close to stone (if that’s where I should head)
[25/09/2023, 13:22:36] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Everywhere I think to meet in town is making me cringe
[25/09/2023, 13:23:08] Zoë “cringe” Turner: But do you wanna just meet at the spoons at the top of the high street and then we can figure it out?
[25/09/2023, 13:23:52] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Wetherspoon

[25/09/2023, 13:24:01] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This one
[25/09/2023, 13:41:16] conall: fantastic, I have never been more excited to go to a spoons
[25/09/2023, 13:42:03] conall: I’m just in Holmes Chapel, I’ve got 35k left. I’ll be two hours tops
[25/09/2023, 14:09:18] Zoë “cringe” Turner: My friends keep asking me if you’re doing this for charity
[25/09/2023, 14:09:26] Zoë “cringe” Turner: And when I say no they say are you sure
[25/09/2023, 15:27:56] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hmm. I’m in Stoke but the train to stone has been cancelled and the next one is 4.25
[25/09/2023, 15:28:29] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I guess I just wait it out, hopefully you’re also delayed
[25/09/2023, 15:56:05] conall: I am here!
[25/09/2023, 15:56:32] conall: I will head to the spoons
[25/09/2023, 15:59:42] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Tell me what you think
[25/09/2023, 16:00:15] Zoë “cringe” Turner: There are definitely better places we can go. That is just my North Star
[25/09/2023, 16:00:39] conall: not to sound flippant but I could not care less
[25/09/2023, 16:00:47] conall: in fact I’ve got a malt loaf to eat
[25/09/2023, 16:00:57] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Sick
[25/09/2023, 16:01:08] conall: i’ll eat it outside the station like a nutcase
[25/09/2023, 16:01:23] conall: damn i already ate half
[25/09/2023, 16:01:24] conall: ffs
[25/09/2023, 16:01:32] conall: was looking forward to that
[25/09/2023, 16:01:44] Zoë “cringe” Turner: hahahaha
[25/09/2023, 16:02:20] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m also just sitting on the platform floor like a nut case but sans malt loaf

[25/09/2023, 16:03:52] conall: the call of the loaf was too strong
[25/09/2023, 16:06:38] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Where is this
[25/09/2023, 16:07:05] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also How do you feel
[25/09/2023, 16:09:58] conall: outside the artisan boutique
[25/09/2023, 16:10:00] conall: whatever that is
[25/09/2023, 16:10:04] conall: fantastic
[25/09/2023, 16:11:25] Zoë “cringe” Turner: amazing x 2
[25/09/2023, 16:11:53] conall: how do YOU feel
[25/09/2023, 16:13:39] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Mostly like I hope the next train arrives
[25/09/2023, 16:15:44] Zoë “cringe” Turner: A bird shat on my bag earlier I have no idea when - this can only be a good thing
[25/09/2023, 16:27:01] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Ok I’m ON IT. I’ll be 10 mins if you’re at the station, 20 if you’re at the pub
[25/09/2023, 16:34:32] conall: aha!
[25/09/2023, 16:34:37] conall: I’m at the platform
[25/09/2023, 21:12:08] conall: Okay I’m totally sold on small town taxis now
[25/09/2023, 21:12:24] conall: Everyone is so nice
[25/09/2023, 21:26:45] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Oh amazing did you get it sorted? And did you get a signature for the book
[25/09/2023, 21:27:47] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m so sorry I just abandoned you in town hahaha
[25/09/2023, 21:28:00] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Dad was like ‘I would’ve given him a lift but couldn’t fit the bike’
‎[25/09/2023, 21:38:37] conall: ‎<attached: 00000517-PHOTO-2023-09-25-21-38-37.jpg>
[25/09/2023, 21:38:48] conall: he was an 8 year old bus conductor
[25/09/2023, 21:38:52] conall: incredible
[25/09/2023, 21:39:30] conall: no need to apologise, I would’ve felt so awks meeting him so I’m glad I high tailed it
[25/09/2023, 21:39:41] conall: oh bless him, he sounds lovely
[25/09/2023, 21:48:36] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This sounds illegal
[25/09/2023, 21:49:12] Zoë “cringe” Turner: But yes I’m glad you made more friends that weren’t my dad. Imagine if you’d got my dad to sign the book
[25/09/2023, 21:55:47] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I had a really nice, stupid night so thank you !!!
[25/09/2023, 22:05:02] conall: it was in Kashmir! Unsure of the child labour laws there. I assume they are lax
[25/09/2023, 22:05:18] conall: That 8 year old ain’t getting flapped I’ll tell you that much
[25/09/2023, 22:05:47] conall: honestly that’d be a dream
[25/09/2023, 22:06:24] conall: I’m glad of your right handed uterus story, but imagine what fact your dad would bring. Something wholesome by the sounds of it
[25/09/2023, 22:07:33] conall: I ALSO had a very nice stupid evening. Couldn’t have asked for a better start to the trip. Thanks for coming out, I’d say let’s do it again but I think sticking to Manc is probably a good shout for future dates
[25/09/2023, 22:35:15] Zoë “cringe” Turner: He brought his expertise all the way from Kashmir to stone to get YOU to tiny bridgeford safely (I hope the bnb is as nice and sterile as the pics implied)
[25/09/2023, 22:35:45] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I still can’t believe this is the fact I picked for my third time meeting you, what a weird thing for you to now know
[25/09/2023, 22:37:16] Zoë “cringe” Turner: You’re so welcome but yes let’s stay in real life territory next time. Have a good 3 hour shower / excellent sleep
[25/09/2023, 22:49:29] conall: I feel truly blessed. The airbnb is VERY sterile. It’s like a hospital, but one of the good ones that aren’t horrendously underfunded
[25/09/2023, 22:50:09] conall: I still don’t understand it. I contemplated asking some girl friends what it meant but I thought that would be weird. I don’t need to know more about your uterus, I know too much already
[25/09/2023, 22:50:40] conall: Sorry I thought we were going to Blackpool for date number 4
[26/09/2023, 09:02:48] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I didn’t explain it very well because I got embarrassed about the words coming out of my mouth
[26/09/2023, 09:03:10] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Don’t cause I obviously 100% would
[26/09/2023, 10:24:15] conall: hahahahaha no need to be embarrassed it’s up there with my favourite fact of the trip
[26/09/2023, 10:24:31] conall: no we’re dating in REAL life from now on
[26/09/2023, 10:24:47] conall: just stopped in West Brom for a sec, bleak round here
[26/09/2023, 11:03:40] Zoë “cringe” Turner: let’s see if that’s still the case by the end of the week
[26/09/2023, 11:05:57] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahaha it’s not nice round there. That boy who broke my heart pre-Paris was from Walsall. Do I need to say more
[26/09/2023, 12:44:34] conall: I’ve got two facts today
[26/09/2023, 12:44:53] conall: had to force Pret Pedro into it
[26/09/2023, 12:45:05] conall: he wasn’t happy but he yielded eventually
[26/09/2023, 12:47:43] conall: It was in my bad books before but now it’s really down the tubes. Didn’t realise 18 year olds in Beech had such a wide dating circle. Village livin’ I guess
[26/09/2023, 14:29:18] Zoë “cringe” Turner: a) was this a man called Pedro who worked in Pret b) what was his quote c) are you in Shakespeare’s garden yet ??
[26/09/2023, 14:30:40] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Well I wasn’t dating people like Liam so I had to cast the net (no offence to Liam)
[26/09/2023, 14:33:30] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I just went to see my pal and her babies, one of them now being 3. His answer to most questions I asked him was ‘trains’ it was amazing. I guess his fact would be trains, if I was collecting them
‎[26/09/2023, 16:07:09] conall: ‎<attached: 00000550-PHOTO-2023-09-26-16-07-09.jpg>
[26/09/2023, 16:07:25] conall: sorry I meant to text
[26/09/2023, 16:07:30] conall: I AM here
[26/09/2023, 16:07:41] conall: I arrived and then fell asleep on the carpet for an hour or so
[26/09/2023, 16:07:50] conall: Didn’t realise how tired I was
[26/09/2023, 16:08:59] conall: This confuses me, but it also doesn’t matter I don’t think. No need to explain. “Liam bad” is the message I got
[26/09/2023, 16:09:40] conall: fantastic child. Trains ARE great. Good that they recognise these things early on. How is your pal doing with yet another baby running about the place
[26/09/2023, 17:16:43] Zoë “cringe” Turner: You’re gonna be able to tell all the ones you forced because they all just say the most mundane thing they did last night but <3
[26/09/2023, 17:17:56] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This doesn’t surprise me at all. What are you gonna do for a whole evening there??? Do you think you can find a rival pasta restaurant that also plays that one Italian classic over and over
[26/09/2023, 17:18:54] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I don’t actually know if Liam is bad, I just know he’s the one who was in the beer garden last night and I never went out with him - anyway irrelevant
[26/09/2023, 17:20:58] Zoë “cringe” Turner: He’s gonna be so into nationalising the railways, a bright future ahead of him. She’s doing amazingly, I was kind of awestruck. Like she’s a celeb from my past living a parallel life
[26/09/2023, 19:07:55] conall: proper phoned in didn’t he
[26/09/2023, 19:09:35] conall: I just wandered round Stratford for a bit while having a natter with my Grandma, almost fell asleep on a bench. Tried to find a local italian but had to settle for an Ask (lame). The music is more varied, it’s just landfill indie which isn’t as good as Ave Maria repeatedly
[26/09/2023, 19:11:31] conall: That’s very sweet. Being awed is a very lovely way to spend a day. Are you seeing any other entities from a past life tonight?
[26/09/2023, 19:11:42] conall: Also, very big news. Very very big news
‎[26/09/2023, 19:11:51] conall: ‎<attached: 00000565-PHOTO-2023-09-26-19-11-51.jpg>
[26/09/2023, 20:54:10] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’ve never heard this phrase before but now I want to hear it ALL the time
[26/09/2023, 20:56:59] Zoë “cringe” Turner: The bench thing reminds me of my friend who had some kinda mid pandemic breakdown and just slept rough in Madrid for a few weeks cause he felt trapped presumably. This anecdote is just to say I hope you’re not having one of those. Your dedication to bad Italians is something to behold
[26/09/2023, 20:58:19] Zoë “cringe” Turner: No no, I’m still trying to chill myself out / just tormenting my brother with questions about his life he doesn’t want to answer
[26/09/2023, 21:00:05] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I feel like this is a bit obnoxious of Stratford. Not sure that they OR you had to come for me and my absent postbox (but I am happy you saw them)
[26/09/2023, 21:09:18] conall: I will reply to all of these tomorrow but after the bench-gate I must get an early night. I am used to being sleepy but this is really something, I feel like I’m floating. Thank you for being very funny
[26/09/2023, 21:11:05] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Wondering if I’m truly very funny or if you’re just on a tiredness high. Float away
[27/09/2023, 04:27:17] conall: You ARE very funny but I am unsure why I wrote that at the end of the message. It seems out of place.

I awoke at 4am this morning. I fear my problem might be some sort of sleep apnea, but no one has ever told me I snore, just that I talk occasionally when sleeping. Maybe my sleep conversations become heated during the hours of 4/5am. I’ve downloaded a snore app, very early 2010’s of me. There’s an app for everything!
[27/09/2023, 04:28:45] conall: I said it wrong, it should be “phoned IT in”, but yes it’s a top tier phrase
[27/09/2023, 04:33:45] conall: That sounds absolutely awful, how did this resolve itself?

Tbh it was mostly because I needed lots of carbs. I could only find a sushi restaurant, Ask, or a pub. I tried the pub but it was one of those “oh we’re so old and cute look how low the roofs are”, I banged my head twice on some beams because I wasn’t paying attention (sleepy) and realised that life was telling me I should eat somewhere with higher ceilings.
[27/09/2023, 04:35:07] conall: Fantastic way to spend an evening. It’s like a bad date but you can’t text them after and say “I had a great time but I just don’t think we’re what each other is looking for”. I hope you learned at least one new fact about his life
[27/09/2023, 04:36:36] conall: I knew this would be your reaction tbh. Clearly the gold postbox thing is a sensitive topic. I’ll refrain from posting them in future, I don’t want to cause a postbox-shaped rift between us.
[27/09/2023, 08:30:50] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Maybe in your delirium you felt compelled to tell me, and I’ll take it. 

Ahhh no. Do you feel okay today? Still good about the ride? Yeah maybe you just shout yourself awake instead of snoring but I feel like somebody would’ve told you this too. On being funny/weird sleep habits, I forgot to tell you this when I saw you but it might make you laugh now - after the last time we hung out in Chorlton, I was in and out of sleep and KEPT waking myself up chatting/laughing like we were still having a conversation??? It was very strange. I think it’s cause I’d not wound down so the date just continued as a dream
[27/09/2023, 08:34:53] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I think he just rode it out, he always talks about it fondly, like it’s just something he had to do. 

Hahaha. Okay well Oxford is next right?? I hope they have carbs in some other form but I do quite like the idea of you rating chain restaurants across the country as you go on only their playlists and ceiling height, food no factor
[27/09/2023, 08:40:11] Zoë “cringe” Turner: TEXT them after???? I’ve heard you just shoot people down right in front of their noses. 

Adam’s fact yesterday was: Archie (his girlfriend’s son) isn’t really bothered about the sunflowers at mum and dad’s coming out, even though they text him photos thinking he’d be very excited, because he has his own flowers he’s growing at home now. So yeah. Don’t expect children to care about more than one flower they’re nurturing I suppose. Not sure this is something that benefits you to know
[27/09/2023, 11:43:44] conall: Not really that tired anymore, although what do I know. I’m clearly a bad judge of these things. Feeling good about the ride though. Just in Woodstock now, just got to Blenheim Palace. A guy asked me if I had a ticket but I just biked through the gate and they didn’t stop me. It’s like I’m in Oceans 11

Also that story is hilarious and cute in equal measure. Thanks for telling me, big fan of that anecdote. Much better than my Ikea one.
[27/09/2023, 11:44:54] conall: Hahahaha, I’ll keep you updated as to the height and playlist selection. Oxford seems like another low ceiling place but I will find out soon enough. Dan is taking me to a nice chippy apparently, I think they have normal ceilings generally
[27/09/2023, 11:48:19] conall: I did that ONCE and learnt my lesson. Never again. I thought it was the respectful thing to do (not waste someone’s time) but very quickly realised it is BAD. You have more innate tact than I do clearly

I didn’t need to know this fact but it seems like it’s caused quite a ruckus if you’re aware of it. I’d be glad that a kid is into one plant, let alone many plants. I wonder if Archie would eat the False Shamrock, and where would he place it on the chart
[27/09/2023, 15:20:15] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Well that’s good!! Absolutely amazing scenes, wish I could’ve seen this unravel in real time. Does this mean we’ve both been to big old houses today? My parents wanted to do something before they dropped me home; it was gonna be the Whitworth but I remembered that my mum wears her Sex Matters badge everywhere (anti-trans group if u don’t know) and I didn’t want the affiliation in work lmao. This is an ongoing thing with her that I have ran out of steam for. So we went to Dunham Massey instead and looked at the old stuff. I found this bowl from 1790 that’s giving 2000s Live Laugh Love/a man with his dog on Hinge:
‎[27/09/2023, 15:20:38] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ‎<attached: 00000584-PHOTO-2023-09-27-15-20-38.jpg>
[27/09/2023, 15:22:19] Zoë “cringe” Turner: The chippy will keep your head safe I think. I didn’t realise you were meeting a pal there that’s nice!! You staying with them?
[27/09/2023, 15:29:33] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It makes me laugh so much, that poor unsuspecting person, and you just trying to do good by her but absolutely stepping in it. I’ll stop talking about it now but just know it’s up there with my faves

Archie would probably love to eat False Shamrock and he would LOVE the chart. He once played a game with me (for too long) where he pretended to be racing the planets, but he was actually methodically ordering them - by what characteristics I don’t know - and I just had to be like OH MY GODDD every time the moon beat Saturn, as if it hadn’t been calculated
[27/09/2023, 18:26:17] conall: We have! I’ve never been to Dunham Massey (as you know, I am still ashamed of my museum visiting skills), I’d like to though. We should go. You’ll be bored but I’ll try to be entertaining somehow so you don’t have to see the same stuff twice. Maybe I’ll take up juggling.

I’m not glad that your Mum is like that, but part of me is because my Dad is also like that. Not the badge wearing kind, but the “I don’t have a problem with it but (insert transphobic comment here)” kind. Very tiresome. I have also given up and normally just divert the convo if it comes up. The badge is a very bold move though, when did she start this?

I LOVE this bowl, or whatever the word for ironically loving something is. Is it next to a 250 year old wood carving that says “You don’t have to be crazy to till the fields, but it helps!”
[27/09/2023, 18:27:44] conall: Yeah it’s ace! He got back from work before and we’ve just been catching up. Gonna head to the chippy, then go out for a pint. He’s given me a fact. I plan to get 3 more tonight (chippy fact, pub fact x 2). I’ll let you know how I get on. You got any plans for the rest of your week off?
[27/09/2023, 18:30:26] conall: I’m glad I’ve managed to provide you some entertainment with my dating ineptitude. I don’t know all these rules!

Absolutely love this about kids. They have all these games, all these ways of pleasing themselves. It’s so nice to watch. I DO agree that the moon should beat Saturn though. Pass that on if you see Archie again
[27/09/2023, 18:32:16] conall: Also, I am utterly obsessed with this Nick Cave album. Very good recommendation. I have probably said this before. I can’t stop listening to it
[27/09/2023, 21:48:29] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Apparently it’s a nice cycle there yknow but you might not ever want to see a bike again after this week… also I wouldn’t be bored, everything would just be in a new perspective, plus if you were gonna take up juggling I’d want to witness that on its own without a fancy backdrop. 

It’s shit isn’t it? And yeah she’s super outward about it all so it’s got quite hard to ignore hence literally deciding not to bring her to the gallery - she’s just convinced herself that trans people are a threat to what she’s learned as feminism I think, and she spends too much time on Twitter, it’s classic middle class retired stuff. Very yuck. 

I don’t understand the crazy till the fields quote but please explain soon thank you 🌾🌾
[27/09/2023, 21:52:28] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This sounds super nice, looking forward to the facts (I hope you don’t think I’m just humouring you, I’m genuinely very involved). 

I dont actually know how I’m going to spend the next two days but that’s exciting especially as I feel basically normal now. I will decide in the morning!! I went to choir for the first time in 3 weeks tonight and lost my voice for about an hour afterwards
[27/09/2023, 21:53:48] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This pleases me. Can you name the standouts yet???? I’m desperate to cross check them
[27/09/2023, 22:28:45] conall: Sounds like a plan. I will stop googling “how to juggle in a way that makes me seem more competent than I was perceived previously”. It wasn’t yielding many results anyway.

Very shit. I don’t really know what to say to my Dad anymore about it tbh, or a lot of politics stuff really. He also spends way to much time on Twitter and tbh it makes him a bit mean at times. Not a big fan of it at all AND he doesn’t have the excuse of being retired
‎[27/09/2023, 22:29:15] conall: ‎<attached: 00000595-PHOTO-2023-09-27-22-29-15.jpg>
[27/09/2023, 22:30:11] conall: Very bad joke tbh. I thought they might till the fields in the 1700’s I guess, so they might have a sign like this but field-tilling related. Not my finest work.
[27/09/2023, 22:36:55] conall: I got no facts Zoë. Not a single fact. Outrageous. I hope this isn’t a sign of things to come. I will have to up my cajoling tomorrow.

That IS exciting. I’m glad you’re feeling better again. I meant to ask this morning at about 7am but I’d already sent you an essay by 4:30 so I figured I’d best not. Very pleased at this development.

Is this the woman’s choir? I think you mentioned this on our first date. Do you do it with anyone else you know or just rock up on your todd? The vocalist from the metal band I used to be in when I was a teenager swore by milkshakes to keep his voice from going. It seemed to work but choir voice is probably stressed differently than screaming voice. Unless you do scream at choir in which case I’d like to watch one day
[27/09/2023, 22:39:59] conall: We No Who U R
Wide Lovely Eyes (possibly my favourite)
Mermaids
Finishing Jubilee Street
Higgs Boson Blues

but tbh there isn’t a bad song on there. I could write the whole track list but that wouldn’t be helpful for you
[27/09/2023, 22:42:25] conall: I’m off to sleep, have a lovely kip. I won’t thank you for being funny tonight. Apologies.
[28/09/2023, 09:13:57] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Competency can only be earned through authentic action - something nobody has probably ever said but that I firmly believe in. 

That’s sad I’m sorry to hear it, it does start to cause a rift. My dad laughs every time there’s a trigger warning for anything now too, like it’s the funniest thing he’s ever seen. Maybe don’t let yours retire
[28/09/2023, 09:16:35] Zoë “cringe” Turner: NOO this is a good joke I just didn’t have the required knowledge of a) this sign and b) what “tilling” is, despite having grown up in the middle of fields probably being tilled all the time??? I’M sorry for not meeting you here, glad you ironically enjoyed the bowl though
[28/09/2023, 09:27:51] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This seems insane and I’m going to go ahead and say it’s cause you were in Oxford and people are definitely more boring there. I bet you get loads of facts on the ferry if you just stay up all night wandering the ship. 

Hahaha - thank you!! And yes that choir. I rocked up on my Todd in January mid winter blues and now I have loads of friends I’ve made there which is really really nice. We all went to bluedot together and drowned in the mud, a true bonding experience. Maybe I’ll try a milkshake pre every rehearsal but I think that would probably make me feel a bit sick. We tend not to scream, last night we were doing Frankie Valli & The Four Seasons so not really scream-worthy. ALSO I was wondering at what point I’d learn you were in a band in a past life, this has stopped surprising me about the people I date but so far I don’t think I’ve had a metal band - the one genre I don’t really understand at all
[28/09/2023, 09:29:52] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Thank you I’ll cross check today. It’s actually perfect for the grey weather. And I am gutted to hear you won’t be calling me hilarious every day but I suppose that was a high expectation. Hope the trip goes well today !!!
[28/09/2023, 12:00:47] conall: See? You ARE better at words than me. I couldn’t come up with something that poignant, especially at 9am.

Yeah it’s very lame but what can you do. I’ve said to him a few times that it does affect how we talk, but if he’s gonna ignore that then that’s up to him I suppose. He also LOVES a trigger warning. I swear they see this stuff more than I do, and I’m one of the “bloody lefties” that apparently love this stuff
[28/09/2023, 12:08:28] conall: I think that’s correct because so far today I’ve already got 7 people to sign it. I’m on a mission.

Very lovely, I didn’t realise you went to BlueDot with those lot! That’s brill. I have heard of Frankie Vallie but I don’t know any songs, or is it one of those “you deffo will”
[28/09/2023, 12:27:16] conall: excuse the abrupt end and subsequent delay, I felt like I was about to collapse. It turns out 2 meal deals, a choc orange, 2 bags of jumbo strawbs is actually NOT enough to sustain me today. Who knew
[28/09/2023, 12:27:27] conall: I have obtained more food and will probably feel better momentarily
[28/09/2023, 12:27:55] conall: also I learned something which might be obvious to you. Mini cheddars are a small version of just “cheddars”
‎[28/09/2023, 12:28:05] conall: ‎<attached: 00000609-PHOTO-2023-09-28-12-28-05.jpg>
[28/09/2023, 12:28:27] conall: I was not aware of this. I thought mini cheddars was just a name unto itself. Not a tiny version of something
[28/09/2023, 12:28:47] conall: I’ll reply to your other messages, I have large format cheddars to eat
[28/09/2023, 12:38:26] Zoë “cringe” Turner: The above messages are largely nonsensical when compared to the matter of your sustenance. Part of me still feels like mini cheddars came first….. I know it wouldn’t make sense…..but I just feel it in my bones. I hope the big ones work / maybe lie on some grass for a while
[28/09/2023, 12:38:49] conall: oh actually I’d basically replied to almost everything. Well I guess you have some extra colour of what I’m up to now
[28/09/2023, 12:39:07] conall: I am sat on a wall
[28/09/2023, 12:39:10] conall: it is not comfy
[28/09/2023, 12:39:28] conall: the big cheddars have helped though, ate the whole pack plus some cream cheese
[28/09/2023, 12:49:29] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I enjoy the details.

My quick fire responses for your wall rest are:
- 7 facts for one morning is fantastic, no wonder your blood sugar is low
- You’ll definitely know The Night it is one of those annoyingly famous songs
- Cream cheese = good. You’ve got this
[28/09/2023, 12:59:41] conall: I’m up to 9 now. What a day. About to start leg 2 of my day. 50 miles down, 50 to go.

I recommend eating some cream cheese. Forgot how great it is. I will not be searching The Night on spotify
[28/09/2023, 13:40:30] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Send best quote of the day when you get to the end point pls 🙏
[28/09/2023, 15:01:55] conall: I will. I’ve just got to Winchester, gonna take a quick pic of the cathedral then bugger off. Still only 3/4 of the way done today. It never ends Zone!

Tell you’re doing something more exciting than me please. I could do with some entertainment
[28/09/2023, 16:11:34] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I went to Winchester once a few years ago and could hear Scouting For Girls playing somewhere close-by. Walked the other way. Hope they weren’t there again. Imagine if they had like a Vegas residency but in Winchester 

I hate to break it to you Conall but you DID decide the cycle to Paris and it WILL end eventually 

I’ve literally just been cycling, so no. Hahaha. Sat under a tree and thought oh Autumn is nice and then very quickly moved when I realised said tree was throwing conkers around
[28/09/2023, 16:48:42] conall: Hahahahaha, heard the claps and fucked right off. Good move. I would like it if there were more residencies. We have one in Blackpool but it’s a guy called Joey Blower and some hypnotist that I used to do the sound for. I forget his name but the show is quite the sight. I’d suggest we’d go but I don’t even think it’d be ironically funny.

Yes THANKS _Zoë_. Today has been a very tough day. I will be sleeping on a ship also AND I may not have a way to get my bike back from Paris. Lots to organise, also that reminds me I need to book Paris accommodation.

Did you at least feel like Isaac Newton for a little bit? I’m unsure what that would feel like but you’ve got an active imagination, you can work it out
[28/09/2023, 16:53:56] conall: You know what I’d love to do right now? Go on a cinema date (bad idea for a date as discussed) to one of those places with the reclining seats. I could fall asleep and no one would be any the wiser. Wouldn’t even need to tell them I wasn’t feeling it at the end, they’d be able to tell because I’d be out cold
[28/09/2023, 17:33:50] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hmm. I’m usually up for these things but something about the name Joey Blower does scream to me ‘don’t go’. Did people actually get hypnotised??? Did you?? Do you think I would?????

Sorry SORRY for being facetious you are over half way and everything is going to be so fine. Tell me more about the ship sleep situation - are there beds being my main question, and how long do you get to stay on the ship? Also WHAT, why is Eurostar like this. There was plenty of room for a bike from what I remember of my one sad Eurostar journey (the Eurostar is so cool to be on by the way I don’t know if you’ve done it before but I hope you do return on it)

I didn’t feel like Isaac Newton but when I got caught in the rain just then I maybe felt a bit like you on my arduous journey from Chorlton > Gorton
[28/09/2023, 17:35:56] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahahaha, I dare you. How long have you got in Portsmouth to find a cinema and a date? Take them to see Past Lives, they will be too busy crying about things that have previously happened to them to mind that you’re asleep
[28/09/2023, 17:37:18] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m pretty sure the last cinema date I went on was at 9am and we saw a film about a couple who were obsessed with volcanoes; so obsessed that they died exploring one. Unsure what the thinking was behind that one

[28/09/2023, 19:17:36] conall: what chain am I in? Can you tell from the ceiling height
[28/09/2023, 19:18:30] conall: I DO have a bad story about the hypno thing but it’s not funny it’s just a woman who got very traumatised and likely is still a bit fucked up from it all tbh. Deffo a 10th+ date convo
[28/09/2023, 19:20:12] conall: I’ve never seen Joey Blower, and yes people do! I never did obviously. I wouldn’t subject myself to that, and also I think you’ve got to give in to it to a certain degree.

There ARE beds and there ARE showers. I can’t wait. I will be so clean with my homemade soap. I’ll keep you abreast of the eurostar faffery
[28/09/2023, 19:20:45] conall: I demand to know the name of this film immediately, I must see it
[28/09/2023, 19:21:26] conall: as am I but I don’t always have the ability to. I am often in bad italian chains with varying ceiling heights
[28/09/2023, 19:22:02] Zoë “cringe” Turner: These are SO high is it Zizzi’s
[28/09/2023, 19:25:41] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Oh okay well I’m glad that it didn’t happen to you. Unsure how these things continue after stuff like that but I guess that’s showbiz baby
[28/09/2023, 19:26:22] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Your half-sandwich soap!!! Yay this is great
[28/09/2023, 19:29:18] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It’s called Fire of Love and it’s actually really good I do recommend it, it’s a doc just full of bubbly volcano footage and nice music
[28/09/2023, 19:38:00] conall: So close. So very close
[28/09/2023, 19:38:13] conall: Blackpool is not a very PC town
[28/09/2023, 19:39:10] conall: I love the name, I love the concept. I love it. I would say let’s watch it together but suggesting to watch a film you’ve already seen on a date is in “is this weird or a bit” territory. Happy to watch it alone. It sounds magical
[28/09/2023, 19:49:58] Zoë “cringe” Turner: If you’re in Ask again I’m gonna suggest you get some range. The only other two are Prezzo and Pizza Express right?? I think my retained chains up to date. It’s Prezzo isnt it. All the Zs
[28/09/2023, 19:51:04] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I mean, we have previously entered the territory/ would argue that we might still be in it
[28/09/2023, 19:51:23] Zoë “cringe” Turner: If we do watch it though let’s not do it at 9am
[28/09/2023, 20:00:46] conall: I’m NOT in Ask again. Who do you think I am? President of the Ask Fan Club?
[28/09/2023, 20:02:43] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahahahahha
[28/09/2023, 20:02:48] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Not putting it past ya
[28/09/2023, 20:05:12] conall: This is very true. I am enjoying this bit. Well let’s watch it then. Although we already have one solid plan (drunk in Levvie), and another possible plan (bike ride to old Live Laugh Love house). As you said some days ago, I fear overwhelme
[28/09/2023, 20:05:41] conall: although if I had to pick between the two, I would choose the stupid film. Big stupid film guy over here
[28/09/2023, 20:17:08] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’d happily choose fire of love right now to override the AWFUL film I just watched for absolutely no reason other than I was eating my tea. That stupid new Netflix film called Accused? Don’t go there, that is my free hot tip of the day. I give it no stars
[28/09/2023, 20:18:22] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Good to have different possible plans for different possible moods no?? Maybe it’ll rain for 8 weeks like it did in summer and nobody will want to go to live laugh love house
[28/09/2023, 20:20:14] conall: Netflix film. Say no more
[28/09/2023, 20:20:29] conall: I would like another free hot tip tomorrow please
[28/09/2023, 20:20:55] conall: More importantly, what was tea
[28/09/2023, 20:21:16] conall: or “what did you have for tea” if I was being proper about my speech
[28/09/2023, 20:26:04] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’ll brew one
[28/09/2023, 20:27:43] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Pie, sweet potato mash, peas, gravy - because Autumn. I’m really trying to mentally ingrain the seasonal change somehow. If I ignore it I will just feel weird when I’m cold
[28/09/2023, 20:28:08] Zoë “cringe” Turner: What was your tea
[28/09/2023, 20:38:57] conall: this is very true. I feel like we’re barrelling towards a volcano film session and I’m here for it
[28/09/2023, 20:40:04] conall: I meant to send that before but my mum rudely interrupted with a phone call
[28/09/2023, 20:40:48] conall: I like this. I never do this with my food. I take full advantage of global supply chains all year round. I should start, I bet it makes you feel like a chef
[28/09/2023, 20:53:34] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This implies the existence of many volcano films. What do you know that I don’t??
[28/09/2023, 20:56:30] Zoë “cringe” Turner: You make it sound like I’m growing the stuff in my allotment when really I’m just thinking ‘what is warm and orange’, I know this isn’t beyond you
[28/09/2023, 20:57:02] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ALSO I hope you’re feeling a bit better??
[28/09/2023, 21:04:38] conall: I’ve seen TWO volcano films
[28/09/2023, 21:04:44] conall: can we have a volcano film night
[28/09/2023, 21:04:57] conall: volcanos are warm and orange!
[28/09/2023, 21:05:53] conall: I have eaten and tbh that’s the only reason I ever feel bad on this ride. Hungry bad, full good. I’m very low on the Maslow pyramid atm
[28/09/2023, 21:06:12] conall: although I did forget to tell you about this hat I found in a bush at the side of the road today
‎[28/09/2023, 21:06:19] conall: ‎<attached: 00000671-PHOTO-2023-09-28-21-06-19.jpg>
[28/09/2023, 21:06:48] conall: doubt I will ever wear it, but like the Royal Mail hat that I also have, the opportunity was too good to pass up
[28/09/2023, 21:18:22] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yeah absolutely I’m DOWN
[28/09/2023, 21:20:08] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahaha does this mean you’ll get to self-actualisation by Paris??
[28/09/2023, 21:21:09] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Wait, no. Maybe this is you self actualised
[28/09/2023, 21:28:17] conall: okay now you know what I WANT to do with this (involve a system of wheels) but I feel that is too much
[28/09/2023, 21:28:24] conall: I have two volcano films though
[28/09/2023, 21:28:30] conall: how to pick which ones to watch
[28/09/2023, 21:28:59] conall: I’m entering my final form. Thank you for validating me
[28/09/2023, 21:34:52] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Well
[28/09/2023, 21:35:47] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I suppose we could split each film into themes and then see which ones marry well?? Is that how the wheels would work
[28/09/2023, 21:36:11] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Honoured to witness it
[28/09/2023, 21:44:38] conall: wait I thought we had a theme (volcanos)
[28/09/2023, 21:45:07] conall: Very open to the idea that I am being slow
[28/09/2023, 21:45:31] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Secondary themes
[28/09/2023, 21:46:16] conall: I like the way you think
[28/09/2023, 21:46:31] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Fire of Love secondary themes: companionship, dedication, risk, documentation
[28/09/2023, 21:47:00] conall: okay
[28/09/2023, 21:47:35] conall: Volcano secondary themes: volcanos, volcanos, volcanos, and a tertiary theme of lava
[28/09/2023, 21:48:00] conall: I apologise for that
[28/09/2023, 21:48:06] conall: but Volcano is not a very deep film
[28/09/2023, 21:48:25] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Oh okay so it really is just about volcanos
[28/09/2023, 21:48:35] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Like a film you’d watch in Geography
[28/09/2023, 21:49:02] conall: It’s about volcano that blows up in Los Angeles. Very bad film really
[28/09/2023, 21:49:21] conall: Tommy Lee Jones phoning it right in
[28/09/2023, 21:49:50] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Lmao
[28/09/2023, 21:49:54] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Right okay
[28/09/2023, 21:49:58] Zoë “cringe” Turner: What about the other one
[28/09/2023, 21:50:07] conall: it is directed by the guy who directed threads though
[28/09/2023, 21:50:24] conall: and threads is great, not sure what happened with Volcano
[28/09/2023, 21:50:53] conall: Dante’s Peak of course!
[28/09/2023, 21:50:55] conall: a classic
[28/09/2023, 21:52:00] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Does threads have any overlapping themes with Fire of Love because I haven’t seen it and I sense an opportunity
[28/09/2023, 21:54:13] Zoë “cringe” Turner: You’ve seen so many disaster films - I’m inexperienced
[28/09/2023, 21:55:04] conall: hmmmm

[28/09/2023, 21:59:44] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also when I google it the synopsis opens with ‘Young LOVERS Ruth and Jimmy decide to get married’
[28/09/2023, 21:59:54] Zoë “cringe” Turner: So

[28/09/2023, 22:01:33] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I do want to watch threads
[28/09/2023, 22:01:39] conall: Threads
Love in The Lava Hole (or whatever your film was called)
James Bond but Rocks and Fire
Volcano
[28/09/2023, 22:01:41] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m sorry I do
[28/09/2023, 22:01:53] conall: I would ALSO like to watch threads
[28/09/2023, 22:02:17] conall: I have listed them in order of priority based on this convo
[28/09/2023, 22:02:27] Zoë “cringe” Turner: What on Earth is James Bond but Rocks and Fire
[28/09/2023, 22:02:32] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Oh Dante
[28/09/2023, 22:02:37] conall: maybe LITLH gets higher billing
[28/09/2023, 22:02:43] conall: it started this whole thing
[28/09/2023, 22:03:22] Zoë “cringe” Turner: No I think Threads first, you’ve really sold it to me inadvertently
[28/09/2023, 22:03:30] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also is Volcano last a wise choice?
[28/09/2023, 22:03:39] conall: it is quite bad
[28/09/2023, 22:03:53] conall: in a sort of fun way but also not at times
[28/09/2023, 22:04:03] conall: okay, threads then volcano
[28/09/2023, 22:04:07] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahahaha
[28/09/2023, 22:04:20] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Can’t wait to find out what kind of volcano experience I’m gonna have
[28/09/2023, 22:04:29] conall: some harrowing darkness, followed by some Tommy Lee Jones idiocy
[28/09/2023, 22:04:32] Zoë “cringe” Turner: If Volcano goes last I think I will say no
[28/09/2023, 22:04:34] conall: now THATS an evening
[28/09/2023, 22:04:44] Zoë “cringe” Turner: So yeah bump it up
[28/09/2023, 22:05:25] conall: THREADS
FOL
VOL
BROZ
[28/09/2023, 22:05:52] conall: you’re gonna love it
[28/09/2023, 22:06:03] conall: Don Cheadle is also in it
[28/09/2023, 22:06:10] conall: and he’s NEVER in anything terrible
[28/09/2023, 22:06:15] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Ok perfect
[28/09/2023, 22:06:38] Zoë “cringe” Turner: FOL isn’t that harrowing by the way it’s more beautiful than anything
[28/09/2023, 22:06:47] conall: I’m excited to watch it
[28/09/2023, 22:06:47] Zoë “cringe” Turner: In case that changes things
[28/09/2023, 22:06:51] conall: it does sound cute
[28/09/2023, 22:07:04] conall: we need a real pallet cleanser after threads
[28/09/2023, 22:07:11] conall: palet?
[28/09/2023, 22:07:16] conall: palett?
[28/09/2023, 22:07:23] conall: none of these look right, whatever
[28/09/2023, 22:07:26] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I think you were right the first time
[28/09/2023, 22:07:32] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Why is it called threads?
[28/09/2023, 22:07:49] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It’s making me think about threadworm and that app that’s trying to be Twitter but is just word Instagram
[28/09/2023, 22:08:57] conall: I don’t think it’s mentioned in the film
[28/09/2023, 22:09:09] conall: it leaves a lot to the imagination tbh, but I really enjoyed it
[28/09/2023, 22:09:29] conall: i watched it ages ago but i remember it well
[28/09/2023, 22:09:41] conall: although my memory is absolutely awful so take that with a grain of salt
[28/09/2023, 22:09:50] conall: what’s threadworm
[28/09/2023, 22:09:56] conall: do I want to know this?
[28/09/2023, 22:24:06] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Is it one of those memories that’s purely feeling
[28/09/2023, 22:24:49] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Like when you try and relay a book you’re sure you loved to someone but there’s 0 plot left in your head
[28/09/2023, 22:25:22] Zoë “cringe” Turner: No I don’t think so x
[28/09/2023, 22:25:57] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I think I’m jealous that you’re on a boat for some reason
[28/09/2023, 22:32:49] conall: you’ve articulated it very well
[28/09/2023, 22:33:10] conall: after we watched it at my mates house we just sort of sat around in silence for 5/10 minutes
[28/09/2023, 22:33:13] conall: it was a lot
[28/09/2023, 22:33:24] conall: you should be it’s very fun
[28/09/2023, 22:33:53] conall: I asked the desk if I could go to the brig as a joke (I’m not sure what the brig is) and they said they need to ask their manager
[28/09/2023, 22:34:31] conall: I said not to bother because I was joking but the language barrier got in the way so I ran off to my room, which feels exactly like my room in uni halls

[28/09/2023, 22:48:37] Zoë “cringe” Turner: To clarify I have never read THE Odyssey either but I’ve just realised that Lara Williams (weird cruise odyssey writer) was definitely doing a literature bit that I missed
[28/09/2023, 22:48:51] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Nah they don’t this is underwhelming
[28/09/2023, 22:49:11] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I appreciate photo > real life discrepancy though

[28/09/2023, 22:50:21] Zoë “cringe” Turner: The it’s nice to hear your voice thing is really sweet but also a bit dramatic like you’re away at war
[28/09/2023, 22:50:35] conall: yes I did think it sounded very lame
[28/09/2023, 22:50:50] conall: but I’d already recorded the voice message 3 times
[28/09/2023, 22:51:13] conall: and tbh it got more unnatural as I re-recorded it, but then the nice voice thing snuck in on the third recording
[28/09/2023, 22:51:18] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I never can and I never will, this is entirely your own dirt
[28/09/2023, 22:51:30] conall: right
[28/09/2023, 22:51:43] conall: I’m currently in my boxers waiting to shower then I need to sleep
[28/09/2023, 22:51:53] conall: very undignified currently
[28/09/2023, 22:52:42] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yeah that part didn’t sound three times attempted and I’m glad
[28/09/2023, 22:52:55] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Ah, I’ve only now realised you don’t have an en suite situation
[28/09/2023, 22:53:04] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Unless you’re waiting for some other reason
[28/09/2023, 22:53:53] conall: I DO
[28/09/2023, 22:54:13] conall: I was waiting because we have been having yet another enrapturing conversation
[28/09/2023, 22:54:46] Zoë “cringe” Turner: hahahaha shut up
[28/09/2023, 22:54:48] conall: also
[28/09/2023, 22:54:55] conall: I’ve just thought
[28/09/2023, 22:55:01] Zoë “cringe” Turner: have a shower / keep your door closed
[28/09/2023, 22:55:08] Zoë “cringe” Turner: But go on

[29/09/2023, 17:06:50] conall: okay
[29/09/2023, 17:06:55] conall: I will have to take notes
[29/09/2023, 17:07:05] conall: as I listen*
[29/09/2023, 17:07:16] conall: I should’ve done this the first time round

[29/09/2023, 17:41:25] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m sitting on the grass because I’ve just bought Ryan loads of books from blackwells before I go to his because I was a BAD friend and didn’t get him birthday presents on time. I hope he likes them. Anyway I think this is maybe my favourite voice message I’ve ever received, the noises you made at the end made me feel like I was having a stroke and I was still having a fantastic time

[29/09/2023, 17:51:08] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Two questions
[29/09/2023, 17:51:16] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Do you listen to your own voice notes back
[29/09/2023, 17:51:30] Zoë “cringe” Turner: And if you were stuck for eternity doing ONE THING what would it be
[29/09/2023, 17:51:46] conall: listening to my own voice notes
[29/09/2023, 17:51:55] conall: answer to this is implied by the previous answer
[29/09/2023, 17:52:10] Zoë “cringe” Turner: hahahahaha
[29/09/2023, 17:52:32] conall: in ALL seriousness
[29/09/2023, 17:52:36] conall: I don’t
[29/09/2023, 17:52:43] conall: well sometimes I have to
[29/09/2023, 17:52:52] conall: to see what you’re replying to
[29/09/2023, 17:53:07] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I got this question from one of those fake Instagram therapists. He encouraged people to put theirs in the comments and I wonder how he would analyse that one
[29/09/2023, 17:53:31] conall: hmmmm
[29/09/2023, 17:53:35] conall: I really don’t know
[29/09/2023, 17:53:39] conall: anything would get boring
[29/09/2023, 17:53:45] conall: there’s not really a good answer
[29/09/2023, 17:54:05] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I do listen to mine usually to affirm myself
[29/09/2023, 17:54:11] conall: love that
[29/09/2023, 17:54:20] conall: how does it affirm
[29/09/2023, 17:54:33] conall: actually
[29/09/2023, 17:54:38] conall: you DO have a very nice voice
[29/09/2023, 17:54:42] conall: maybe that’s the difference
[29/09/2023, 17:54:54] conall: if I was you I’d probably enjoy listening to mine
[29/09/2023, 18:04:03] conall: also I never listened to this. Oops
[29/09/2023, 18:18:45] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It’s less this and more ‘oh yes I communicated that well :)’
[29/09/2023, 18:19:16] Zoë “cringe” Turner: So nice you forgot to listen to 7 minutes of it
[29/09/2023, 18:19:50] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I like yours. For some reason I can hear the Blackpool way more than when you’re in front of me
[29/09/2023, 18:24:36] conall: I think it’s because I am more excitable in person, much easier to keep a lid on it when you’re talking to a black rectangle
[29/09/2023, 18:25:05] conall: I don’t have a response to this
[29/09/2023, 18:25:24] conall: I DID listen to it and forgot most of it but I do remember being impressed you did it off the dome
[29/09/2023, 18:25:58] conall: I’m just gonna head to Planet Mars because that seems like a fun place to go. Unsure of the ceiling height or the cuisine. I hope it’s Mars based food
[29/09/2023, 18:26:26] conall: Then I will reply because I do remember having to respond to somethings

[29/09/2023, 19:28:14] conall: you’re not gonna believe this Zoë

[29/09/2023, 19:48:11] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Insane
[29/09/2023, 19:48:20] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Did I set this in motion on Monday?
[29/09/2023, 19:48:58] Zoë “cringe” Turner: And why are there 3 different tiramisus
[29/09/2023, 19:52:15] Zoë “cringe” Turner: James has put Peter Kay on the tele - this is an ongoing bit here because I watched a Peter Kay set for the first time some months ago at theirs and kept deeming him ‘the next big thing’ and ‘my greatest discovery’. We all found it hilarious but I don’t know if it translates outside of the group. This is my test
[29/09/2023, 19:52:18] conall: ceiling height: fine
[29/09/2023, 19:52:30] conall: hahahahahahah
[29/09/2023, 19:53:15] conall: no, solid work there
[29/09/2023, 19:53:38] conall: I laughed a bit and then the french lady asked me in french something as she was bringing me a beer
[29/09/2023, 19:53:50] conall: it’s possible she’s a big Peter Kay fan
[29/09/2023, 19:54:41] conall: I love the concept of a Tiramisu 2.9
[29/09/2023, 19:54:45] conall: 2.0*
[29/09/2023, 19:59:32] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Great I’m glad this travelled
[29/09/2023, 19:59:48] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahaha you should’ve just pointed at the text
[29/09/2023, 20:17:17] conall: I’ve already done too much pointing

[29/09/2023, 20:18:01] conall: bit of wall and ceiling (the most important bit)
[29/09/2023, 20:19:25] conall: also how have you never seen Peter Kay? Is this a stoke thing? Maybe you’re just passed the cutoff. I feel like he has been inescapable my whole life.

I tried to show my Russian ex Phoenix Night’s (ask your mates, they’ll know if you don’t). She did NOT get it at all, even though she had lived in London for about a decade. Too much north.
[29/09/2023, 20:26:20] Zoë “cringe” Turner: A Futurama mural! The epitome of French/Italian class
[29/09/2023, 20:28:31] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This was also their question, I don’t know the answer - I have a vague memory of my mum pissing herself whenever he was on the TV, but I think maybe I was a bit young to pay attention. Also I’m not actually northern am I 

I think we saw a bit of Phoenix Nights when I discovered him. Ryan says it probably wouldn’t be made now as at one point he plays a man in a wheelchair
[29/09/2023, 20:29:49] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also I’ve just shaved my eyebrow for style purposes. I think everyone at work tomorrow is just going to be like, what have you done to your eyebrow
[29/09/2023, 20:31:06] conall: Sorry to be the bearer of bad news but it’s the simpsons / wall-e
[29/09/2023, 20:31:19] conall: although WALL-e is a great theme for a mural
[29/09/2023, 20:32:10] conall: That’s very true you’re not but I don’t understand what is or isn’t northern tbh.

It’s not at one point, it’s his character the entire show!
[29/09/2023, 20:32:24] conall: I am excited to see this. You gone full chav with it
[29/09/2023, 20:43:58] Zoë “cringe” Turner: oh yeah they are simpsons aliens sorry
[29/09/2023, 20:44:02] Zoë “cringe” Turner: THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME
[29/09/2023, 20:44:25] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’d still watch it, my comedy hero

[29/09/2023, 20:45:24] Zoë “cringe” Turner: James couldn’t get the bottom bit off so that’s still there
[29/09/2023, 20:51:39] conall: wow
[29/09/2023, 20:52:33] conall: it is quite funny, lots of idiocy. I haven’t watched in years but I’m sure it’ll still hold. s up well-£
[29/09/2023, 20:52:44] conall: wet hands types this
[29/09/2023, 20:53:13] conall: loving this pic, not just because of the eyebrow. Lots going on
[29/09/2023, 20:53:33] conall: full chav is the multiple stripes down the eyebrow, you’ll know what I mean
[29/09/2023, 21:05:07] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I don’t think we can add this to the volcano marathon
[29/09/2023, 21:05:24] Zoë “cringe” Turner: hahaha is it the giraffe tongue
[29/09/2023, 21:05:38] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Okay well in that case no. I have taste

[29/09/2023, 21:12:25] conall: when are we doing that anyway
[29/09/2023, 21:12:56] conall: I news some big volcs in my life, this ride has given me a taste for lava

[29/09/2023, 21:21:28] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Can decide next Friday can’t we, I am waiting for you to get back to the country first
[29/09/2023, 21:22:12] Zoë “cringe” Turner: hahahahahaha ugh, the red carpet
[29/09/2023, 21:22:26] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Do you think she saw it coming? She had a long time to guess what was about to happen
[29/09/2023, 21:22:53] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Have you just replied like ‘wow mate looks amazing!’
[29/09/2023, 21:29:51] conall: Very true. I need to be prepared for the possibility that you’re an incredibly obnoxious and rude drunk also. Can’t watch Volcano with someone like that, I’m sorry
[29/09/2023, 21:31:04] conall: It’s very Blackpool, just if Blackpool had money
[29/09/2023, 21:31:25] conall: I’ll quote:

“Bloody hell I bet she’s over the moon!”
[29/09/2023, 21:31:42] conall: which tbf, isn’t a lie. I bet she is over the moon
[29/09/2023, 21:40:29] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I don’t think I am one of these, but I’m unsure how I’d describe myself. It’s all to play for. I bet you’re an obnoxious drunk
[29/09/2023, 21:41:38] Zoë “cringe” Turner: An honest response, I respect this
[29/09/2023, 21:43:58] conall: Offensive. I’m a noxious drunk, or whatever the opposite is. I think noxious is just poison
[29/09/2023, 21:46:22] conall: I look forward to it. For now, sleep. Let me know a good time for me to call tomorrow, I think I’ll be at the big tower at 2ish. Probably later. Enjoy Eyebrows. Enjoy Kay
[29/09/2023, 21:51:51] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Excited to find out what this means

[30/09/2023, 18:06:31] Zoë “cringe” Turner: BUT don’t worry I was very aware of the fact you’d been cycling for 5 days and I was like Eiffel Tower!!!!!!!!!! And you weren’t there yet and that’s fine
[30/09/2023, 18:08:02] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hope you find some clothes & pints. Thank you for offering to walk with me away from my home, I kinda feel like I’m ranting too much to people about it, but I really appreciate it
[30/09/2023, 18:08:10] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Let me know what you end up doing with your eve
[30/09/2023, 19:53:36] conall: fantastic, glad you’re out (presumably) having fun
[30/09/2023, 19:55:10] conall: hahahaha very understanding of you. I have found clothes, pints and a tiny arc de triomphe, I am very pleased with myself for this whole thing now. Who doesn’t love a little self-imposed hardship every now and again
[30/09/2023, 19:56:44] conall: also don’t worry yourself about venting honestly it’s fine. It sounds shit but you’ll get it sorted one way or another. EVENTUALLY that guy has to go to the toilet or something
[30/09/2023, 19:56:59] conall: also look what I just walked past, I had no idea this was a real place (I am very cultured)

[01/10/2023, 03:37:09] conall: Thanks for keeping me abreast of the goss, I am invested. Although it is bad news in some ways because it confirms your suspicions. Guys like this are quite shitty. My mate Iona was in a relationship with one for a period of time and it was quite suffocating but I think she just needed to be in a relationship so it carried on

Didn’t go into the red windmill. I should have but I was on a food mish. Met some aussies at this bar Kate recommended. Had a fun evening but as ever woke up at 4am.

This sleep / sinus situation needs to be resolved or at least abated somewhat. I’m going to go to a pharmacy today to try to find one of those spray things for my nose. At least if I wake up in the night I can clear myself out I guess? That’s the current theory. Need to see a GP tbh though
[01/10/2023, 03:40:19] conall: OH also loving the tarot reading. Couldn’t tell if you got one last night or booked it for the future though. I’ve always wanted to get one done (for the same reasons, it seems very silly). I think my new housemate has a set but I don’t know if getting a reading at home is the same vibe, we do have incense though so maybe that’s enough to set the tone
[01/10/2023, 08:30:22] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Thanks for investing - and yeah I get that. Morning revelation I’ve just had: I think I might also have been in a relationship a bit like this, maybe that’s why I feel so weird. 

No worries about the red windmill, there were probably better things to be seen. I’m glad you met some fun people!! But this 4am thing does need to stop. Before I got stuff prescribed I just used to use the Sudafed nose unblocking stuff so maybe try that before you go to sleep and then when you wake up making silly noises??
[01/10/2023, 08:33:02] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Have not yet got the reading, definitely would’ve told you what they’d said if I had. I actually think home-tarot would be a much more sensible place to start, do it. Maybe it’ll tell you something important about your nose, or what kind of creative direction your new bed should take
[01/10/2023, 11:25:50] conall: Ah that makes a lot of sense, you’ll be better at spotting the signs of this stuff. Sorry you went through that, it sounds dire. Guys with dogs honestly, what’s the deal? My old flat mate does a similar thing, leveraging the dog in his dating. It can happen naturally and that’s fine, but when he’s chatting explicitly about it like it’s his “strategy” - it‘s a bit yikes-y
[01/10/2023, 11:26:34] conall: I have pointed and said “decongestant” in a french accent in a pharmacy. She didn’t give me sudafed but this spray, she was very positive about the whole thing. I couldn’t understand her but her positivity about my nose has rubbed off. Thanks for the tip, noses in arms and all that
[01/10/2023, 11:27:27] conall: Hahaha of course, didn’t put that together in my stupor. Excited to hear what they tell you about dog-man, or what direction you should take your eyebrows next. A whole new world of possibilities is open to you now
[01/10/2023, 13:15:54] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Right?? Like, I didn’t even know you had 4 dogs at home (plus visiting dogs) until this week, nor did I need to. Dog-man has a tattoo of his dog by the way, I don’t know if I’ve told you that yet. He showed me and I had to be like ‘yeahhhh legend’
[01/10/2023, 13:16:42] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Amazing. I can’t imagine being that positive about someone else’s congestion, kudos to her
[01/10/2023, 13:17:17] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I am mainly scared they will foresee disaster. Actually why am I doing this
[01/10/2023, 13:17:41] Zoë “cringe” Turner: How is Paris today? I have an update and it’s that I’ve eaten the pasta
[01/10/2023, 15:21:15] conall: Oh of COURSE he does. Pathetic. I like dogs but I do think there’s just something off about dog guys. Idk maybe I’ve just interacted with a bad set.

I would‘ve loved to have been a fly on the wall during this interaction. I’m not sure what you’re “okeyyy” face is, but I imagine it’s hilarious
[01/10/2023, 15:22:06] conall: It has helped already tbh. I’m choosing to believe it’s good vibes she gave me, instead of the nose drugs
[01/10/2023, 15:23:42] conall: I asked Kate if she did do a reading, that she needs to remove all the bad cards, she said it doesn’t work like that but didn’t explain further. I have the same worries as you. It’s all BS but tell the bad stuff to the other people, not me!
[01/10/2023, 15:28:47] conall: This is just the sort of update I was hoping for. I would ask further pasta questions but in text form it won’t be very funny.

Paris is lovely. I have been to the louvre but only quickly tbh, it’s so big I guess you could spend a week in there. ALSO Mona Lisa, you’re right. Bad vibes there. Weird. It is a lovely painting up close-ish though.

Then I went to Rodin’s garden, favourite thing I’ve seen so far. I’d heard of him but never checked his stuff out (I think maybe that book I read recently spoke about him). There was a lot of anguished statues in a lovely garden with very nice trees and plants. Right up my alley

Just in Mon Matre getting a beer then I’m going to find this graveyard that’s meant to be good for some reason. Unsure what I’m doing later but my new friend Alexi who lives above me said he’ll get in touch because he’s going out for drinks

Tell me the best thing you have seen all of today
[01/10/2023, 15:33:02] conall: it has just occurred to me that the last thing I said was your hinge prompt. Very cringe. Although it is a good question so I’d like to know the answer anyway
[01/10/2023, 20:54:54] Zoë “cringe” Turner: How very holistic of you! Who needs big pharma
[01/10/2023, 20:56:59] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahahaha. I think Kate probably means that you can’t choose your own fate, if you’re going in you’re going IN, submitting yourself completely, etc etc
[01/10/2023, 21:04:54] Zoë “cringe” Turner: You could definitely spend a week in the Louvre that’s true, maybe there’s a little known hour once every 7 days where nobody gathers around the Mona Lisa. It sounds like you got pretty close though - I wonder who got closer, you (2023) or I (2014). I googled Rodin’s garden earlier and those anguished statues look AMAZING. So much pensiveness going on, I’d love to see these. 

Oh the cemetery with everyone famous in it??? I saw the one for that man from The Doors, it was okay. Can’t believe you’ve made friends with your upstairs neighbour already. Well I can actually. Hope he writes something very exciting in your book
[01/10/2023, 21:11:00] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This is funny. The amount of people who just reply ‘you’ to that is awful. I would like to say that the best thing I’ve seen today is the film I just saw but it was the new Ken Loach film so it was obviously very bleak. My colleague (weird word but I guess most appropriate here) was leaving work like ‘what are you doing tonight’ and I said I don’t know I might just watch a film and he said WELL I’m going to see this one about Syrian immigrants and community tensions do you want to come and I said OKAY and then had to watch a big dog eat a small dog and see a very sad man’s pub get destroyed so now I’m not sure whether that was the right response. This was a drawn out reply and I’m not even sure it answers your question
‎[01/10/2023, 21:15:12] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ‎<attached: 00000966-PHOTO-2023-10-01-21-15-12.jpg>
[02/10/2023, 07:16:55] conall: I did get quite close but it was only because there was a big tour group in front of me, they moved and I got right up to the little velvet rope. Maybe Sad Paris Zoë wasn’t as fortunate (not a great weekend for her overall by the sounds of it). I was going to take a very bad picture with my thumb covering the painting on the lens because I thought that would be funny, but I couldn’t commit. A low point for me really.

Definitely get your arse to Rodin’s garden if you’re ever here again, it’s beautiful.

No! The one in Mon Matre with lots of not famous people in it. If I get my boxes and bike sorted today I will be going to see Oscar Wilde’s grave which is in the same graveyard as Doors man. It’ll probably just be fine but I read Dorian Gray recently so I figure why not.

I have bad news about the notebook, I haven’t taken it anywhere because the rural french trained me to forget about it! No signatures in Paris. Very disappointing. I’ve lost my groove with it.
[02/10/2023, 07:26:01] conall: Almost vomited a little bit at getting “you” as a reply. I got a like a week or so before we met on my wood turning picture, it just said: “lathe? 🥵🥵🥵”

What am I supposed to say to that? “You know it baby 😏😏”?

I wanted to go to see that Ken Loaf film, although I think my desire was just aspirational tbh. It’s hard to pick a day to go and be depressed for two hours. Also I had no idea about the big/small dog eating, you’ve successfully cured me of any desire to watch it. Maybe I’ll stick on Kes next week instead. Haven’t seen it in years but I remember it being very sad, and not in a Threads way.

And no it didn’t answer my question but I enjoyed the slice-of-life nature of it. You really painted a picture
[02/10/2023, 07:26:24] conall: great vibes coming off this cat
[02/10/2023, 07:27:05] conall: I tried to reply to all of these messages last night when I got in, but I was too drunk and sleepy. Going out with a russian and an irishman is not a recipe for a sober evening
[02/10/2023, 14:32:25] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I wanna know why you couldnt commit to this, did it feel wrong in the moment because it’s such an old famous painting? Was guilt involved? Or did you just not have the audience. For what it’s worth, I think I would’ve laughed. 

Oh yeah I saw Oscar Wilde’s too!! His was a bit better actually, BIGGER and inspired lots of queer love letters if I’m remembering correctly. Hopefully you’ve seen it and can confirm or deny. I’m trying not to ask you about the boxes, even though I don’t know what you mean, and about getting your bike home as aware this might still be contentious 

NO :( that’s very disappointing. Maybe we should just make up a load of French facts when you’re back
[02/10/2023, 14:36:38] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahahaha the emojis. I do kind of love that though, very bold.

Yeah, I’m not sure if I recommend it. I can’t even remember if I’ve seen Kes but I’ve seen all his new ones; the one about the delivery driver made me want to DIE.
[02/10/2023, 14:39:23] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Need more info about Russian and irish men. 

Also, I think I’ve successfully wrangled ‘girls night’ tonight. I’ve got an extra large cauliflower for the dinner I’m gonna make but, like the whole cheddars debacle, there were only extra large cauliflowers, no large, no small. It’s thrown me off a bit and now I understand how you must have felt

[03/10/2023, 07:41:32] conall: Morning, hope you’re doing alright after that creep last night. No idea what guys think they’re going to get out of an interaction like that. I can’t imagine stalking someone for 20 minutes has ever led to a fantastic romance. Sorry it happened.

Glad that you managed to give your cauliflower speech though. Are you feeling a bit better about the whole thing now?

It sounds like quite a draining day overall tbh. Hope you manage to enjoy yourself today if you’re working (I’ve forgotten which day you said you have off normally)
[03/10/2023, 07:42:18] conall: P.S. if you’re not working, I also hope you manage to enjoy yourself
[03/10/2023, 12:08:51] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It was quite draining but I won’t bore you with it now!!! Feeling kind of better / decided I am just going to have a nice week. I am working but we did some free writing in the briefing this morning which sounds like the most stupid art gallery job thing ever and I suppose it is but it was cute.
[03/10/2023, 12:09:32] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ALSO they tried to put me on call on Friday and I was like no
[03/10/2023, 13:14:34] conall: I don’t understand the free writing thing, do you just write what you want for the morning? That sounds delightful
[03/10/2023, 13:15:54] conall: If I’m also allowed to come and we can sneak around the museum at night then I feel you’ve made the wrong choice (I imagine it’s more boring than that)
[03/10/2023, 14:08:47] Zoë “cringe” Turner: No but that’s also a nice idea. You’re supposed to write just whatever comes into your head but it’s hard to do cause you have to suspend thinking. A but like when you’re trying NOT to impress your journal, an impossible ask
[03/10/2023, 14:10:35] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I did think about it because essentially we could but it would be less exciting heist vibes due to security following us around and also I couldn’t drink because I’d likely forget my alarm code and make everything much worse
[03/10/2023, 14:11:26] Zoë “cringe” Turner: How is today??
[03/10/2023, 14:11:38] Zoë “cringe” Turner: For you
[03/10/2023, 15:41:04] conall: hahahahaha this still gets me. The thought of journaling not helping you because you’re trying to be aloof and cool is just great
[03/10/2023, 15:42:12] conall: Very very boring. I would absolutely LOVE to be in a museum at night on my own (/ with you). You have a reputation to maintain there annoyingly so we can sneak in somewhere else. I assume the British Museum has lax security
[03/10/2023, 15:44:36] conall: Today is pretty good thanks. I’m in London now (I’ll send the obligatory bike pic). Train got cancelled so I’m gonna have to change getting my bike on the next one. Looking forward to getting back to manc, gonna whip by the pottery class en route home to glaze that soap dish / a big box I’ve made. Then finally get home and CHILL. I need to buy some bath stuff, I’ve never wanted a bath more in my whole life. What’s your plans this eve?
‎[03/10/2023, 15:44:49] conall: ‎<attached: 00000990-PHOTO-2023-10-03-15-44-49.jpg>
[03/10/2023, 17:47:16] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hey, ANYBODY could stumble across it
[03/10/2023, 17:53:37] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Wouldn’t it be amazing. I’ve been scheming since I started but the only way seems to be to have someone from security on side, not sure whether they are known for debauchery. Although one of the alarm engineers did send me a very ambiguous ‘hey’ text of an evening once so I wonder whether I could reply 6 months later purely for scheme purposes
[03/10/2023, 17:59:01] Zoë “cringe” Turner: He only went and did it. And fuck yeah soap dishes. This is going to be the best bath you’ve EVER had. 

I’m not doing anything! It’s my only free eve so I think I might do some spare-rooming / job searching / general life scheming. So much scheming today I don’t know. Also need to buy some waterproof trousers. Keep forgetting to do that until it is raining
[03/10/2023, 17:59:38] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Extra gorgeous on home soil and with abandoned cig packet 💘
[03/10/2023, 19:02:39] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m concerned about these Parisian bed bugs
‎[03/10/2023, 20:38:51] conall: ‎<attached: 00000996-PHOTO-2023-10-03-20-38-51.jpg>

[03/10/2023, 20:40:41] conall: I’m loving the amount of scheming you’re thinking about. Scheme this, scheme that. I’ve always wanted to be involved in a caper but I know because of my programming background I’d end up playing the nerd hacker role. What heist archetype would you be?
[03/10/2023, 20:42:42] conall: I have lots of questions about spare room AND job but they’re better for in person I think. Unless you want to talk about it now in which case I’ll ask away

I ALSO need to buy some waterproof trousers. My new Parisian uniqlo cords just got absolutely soaked on the way to pottery. Just not cricket is it. Let me know what you find, I’ve never gone down that rabbit hole before
[03/10/2023, 20:42:58] conall: tell that to my legs
[03/10/2023, 20:45:04] conall: I would send a picture but I’ve realised that leg pictures fall under our “gap of perception”. They could be mosquito bites though

I only heard about the bed bugs when I got there and googled a lot to make sure the bed was free of them. Also didn’t sit down on any trains or metros. They’re apparently quite easy to spot (according to google)

All my clothes are getting washed 3 times and then dried within an inch of their life regardless
[03/10/2023, 20:46:16] conall: also shouldn’t have gone to pottery. Always forget how long things take. I glazed this though, didn’t have time for the soap dish because of my slowness / incompetence 

How’s the schemevning going?
[03/10/2023, 22:29:33] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This is interesting. It’s very big and square, I can only imagine it’ll be used for big square things
[03/10/2023, 22:31:20] Zoë “cringe” Turner: What’s wrong with the nerd hacker role?? I feel like they’re quietly respected. I don’t know if there’s a project leader involved in heists usually but I’d be that one - keep me in the background spinning plates
[03/10/2023, 22:35:44] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahahaha. I love how thorough this response is. Bed bugs = covered. I reckon if you got them anywhere you got them in Evreux. Also do you think that duvet you had was so ugly to try and keep the bed bugs away??? Wow I bet so many people in Paris are having so much fun telling their loved ones not to let the bugs bite every night and laughing but also meaning it
[03/10/2023, 22:40:35] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Scheming has been semi-productive. The only waterproof rabbit hole I went down was Decathlon .com and turns out that’s the only one you really need. I will fill you in about room/job stuff when I see ya, it’s just my ‘time to overhaul several aspects of your life at once’ alarm going off, it happens every 8-12 months
[03/10/2023, 22:42:29] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Oh and I know they won’t translate accurately via image but I do hope your legs are okay AND that you got the bath stuff
[03/10/2023, 22:43:40] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Welcome home !!!
[03/10/2023, 23:09:33] conall: I’m going to put my enormous collection of rubik’s cubes in it
[03/10/2023, 23:11:56] conall: Very true, I suppose I am just trying to rebel against being typecast in this way. I just wanna be the high-wire guy, hanging from the ceiling and dodging lasers
[03/10/2023, 23:12:23] conall: (I would be terrible at this in a comedic manner but I would never let the team down during high intensity moments)
[03/10/2023, 23:20:01] conall: Ooh now that’s a theory I like. Maybe that’s why it was so plasticky! Damn I wish I’d have asked when I was there
[03/10/2023, 23:20:17] conall: also very good joke RE bed bugs you should be very proud of yourself
[03/10/2023, 23:24:45] conall: Decathlon sells so much stuff. I know this is a trite observation but I had to go in one in Paris for the boring bike bag/box saga and it was a lot. Equipment for sports I hadn’t even heard of. Confusing racquets.

I know the feeling, new beginnings are always fun in some ways, new gear new you. Looking forward to hearing about your upcoming schemes
[03/10/2023, 23:25:15] conall: This was supposed to say new year but considering your waterproof pants purchase I suppose gear also applies
[03/10/2023, 23:29:04] conall: The legs aren’t okay and the bath wasn’t had. I did have an amazing shower and a good catch up with Kate though. MAFSUK was put on but everyone is just arguing and not in a fun way. How are you enjoying the show? I’m not in on the characters so maybe I’m just not invested
[03/10/2023, 23:29:35] conall: Thank you! Very happy to be back
[04/10/2023, 11:26:47] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I can absolutely believe this
[04/10/2023, 11:28:13] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This is what I was thinking!! You should’ve queried this with Alexi or whatever their name was. Can’t believe bed bugs are the new covid
[04/10/2023, 11:35:04] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Is this how racquets is spelt??? I’ve been doing this wrong. Unless you’re making a French joke
[04/10/2023, 11:36:07] Zoë “cringe” Turner: New gear new me is what I’m gonna say every time I buy a new garment now
[04/10/2023, 11:38:01] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Ugh it is getting a bit sloggish now. That tattooed man has some mad manipulation tactics going on, and I can’t stand it when they say consummate the marriage. Nobody needs to be saying that word in that context ever
[04/10/2023, 11:38:57] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Are you straight back into work??
[04/10/2023, 14:34:17] conall: I must have been because the rest of the room / flat was v tasteful and nice. I’d take covid 900 times before I ever have to deal with a bed bug, I’d never read much about them until this trip. They’re little tanks, totally unkillable but normal human means
[04/10/2023, 14:35:16] conall: Hmmm I think so and I refuse to check. Men are from racquets, women are from rackets, or whatever they say
[04/10/2023, 14:36:35] conall: I like consummate but I only in an ironic way. In fact actually I think even in that sense it would kill the mood a bit. Okay maybe I agree with you

The tattoo man is so obviously a devious man and I barely heard him talk, what’s your favourite couple? I need someone to root for here. They all seem dull as
[04/10/2023, 14:56:19] conall: Disappointingly yes, I don’t know why I didn’t book another day off. I always make this mistake with holidays / festivals and I never learn my lesson.

ALSO work is horrific today. Very stressful, idiotic CEO. Very annoying. How is YOUR day going? Better I hope
[04/10/2023, 17:27:07] Zoë “cringe” Turner: When have you ever said consummate in an ironic way and have it go down well

ERM I think my fave ones are Laura and whatever her husband is called - ARTHUR just remembered - only because they are the most interesting. She appears stuck up but has surprised me with her patience and seeming warmth towards him. And he seemed not very emotionally intelligent but then it transpired he was merely hiding in insecurities. You probably don’t know which ones these are but I’m talking anyway
[04/10/2023, 17:31:49] Zoë “cringe” Turner: A classic mistake, probably just hardwired at this point I’m sorry to say. Also sorry that you have an idiotic CEO, I have never worked anywhere that has a CEO so they are only a negative figment of my imagination. LOG OFF. 

My day is fine, I just got a flu jab and am walking down curry mile occasionally waving my arm in the air because I heard this stops it going stiff once? Seeing my friend play band on the wall tonight. It’s the same friend I meant to go and see about 3 weeks ago, I don’t just have loads of music friends
[04/10/2023, 21:09:54] conall: Hmm very good point. I can’t remember a time where I have but if I did it would be filed under the same drawer as “the time when Conall said he didn’t enjoy a date to their face”

I’ll keep a look out for Laura and Author. Also very much enjoying your stream-of-consciousness texting. It’s like you’re using a typewriter
[04/10/2023, 21:17:50] conall: This is what I feared. God it’s like I’m getting a tarot card reading. I have stepped off the log and seen an old friend in media city. Bad vibes all round. I’ll explain when I see you

A flu jab! Is this because of nose-gate? The waving the arm in the air thing definitely does work. I did it after a covid jab and hit a very nice woman in the head because I wasn’t paying attention. Felt awful obviously but she was very understanding of my need to not have my arm ache. I trust you haven’t accidentally punched anyone today.

You don’t need many musical friends, just one somewhat prolific one. I WISH I had more musical friends (currently one). I’m seeing Boney-M tomorrow. Maybe I can make friends with them, then I’ll have five more
[04/10/2023, 22:34:15] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Ah yes, my favourite drawer. Would it ruin the typewriter illusion if I told you I had to go back to insert the ARTHUR part? Nobody could do that on a typewriter could they I imagine they were actually super annoying to use
[04/10/2023, 22:40:59] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Oh nooo:( I hope it’s not just more of the same tomorrow?? Good to get out and vent about it though. I await The Scoop

Hahaha ffs it’s like I’m a deteriorating old person. I play my asthma card!! I have ALL respiratory issues. I didn’t hit anybody but very well could’ve done seeing as I was texting you at the same time. The world needs more people who understand why you’re flailing your arm around on the pavement though, good for her 

Tonight I learned what a Rider is - if you were a music person what would be on your rider list?? Adam’s wasn’t exciting. I wonder what’s on Boney-M’s Rider? Can you please find out tomorrow when you end up backstage. Band on the wall makes me feel ancient, everybody there is 20 years old, probably going to avoid in future
[04/10/2023, 23:10:29] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Do you want to hear a clip of my friend on the bus home: student night edition

[05/10/2023, 06:20:59] conall: It does a little bit but only a little. I’m still imagining you with a whole steam-punk iPhone setup. It’ll only take a few more bombshell like that to shatter this illusion though
[05/10/2023, 06:25:41] conall: No work was fine (well it wasn’t it WAS stressful but whatever), I mean the friend was the bad vibes bringer. Actually I can say this in person anyway.

They do, did you get any looks? I guess you wouldn’t have known. Head in the phone and all that.

Very fun thing to learn of an evening. I’d like to know what was on Adam’s but tell me after I give you mine. I’ve had a rider exactly once in my life and I asked for a bottle of jeagerneister (I was 17 in my defence).

I will think of what I’d like on current Conall’s rider but I am very sleepy. The 4am wake up has returned with a vengeance. Gonna head to the gym to tire myself out and hopefully I can get a midday nap in after I do my required work today. Very frustrating, the french nose lady was so positive!
[05/10/2023, 06:26:39] conall: This is fantastic. I like everything about this. The horrible singing, the recording quality, it’s like a russian dash cam video. Great work from everyone involved
[05/10/2023, 09:56:48] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I will keep the rest to myself
[05/10/2023, 10:04:59] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Ah okay! A new level of bad vibes. Our docket feels more serious this time you know. 

The jagermeister thing is SO 17 I love that. Adam’s was a bottle of spiced rum, a bottle of Prosecco, a crate of beer, satsumas and hummus and pitta. I suppose you’ll quite like the satsumas part actually. Off the top of my head/this morning, mine would be a supermarket birthday cake (vic sponge) you know the shit ones that are really good for like one slice and then you can’t look at it again? And loads of glass cokes with a bucket of ice/lemon + vodka cause I suppose there always needs to be something hard requested in a rider. 

I fear her witchcraft only works within the boundaries of France. Get to the GP and ask if they want to hear that recording of you asleep
[05/10/2023, 10:06:09] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m assuming it’s so bad cause she was maybe trying to record discreetly hahaha. Apparently they were in the aisle of the bus pretending to row. I love that this behaviour NEVER changes. The songs are all the same songs. Obsessed
[05/10/2023, 12:02:16] conall: I feared this might happen. I liked the peak behind the curtain, now I have ruined it for myself
[05/10/2023, 12:05:15] conall: The docket is barely touched I feel. Also we’re getting drunk so I predict our conversation to be even more tangent-filled than it is normally (this is not a bad thing)

Damn Adam’s got his rider sorted right out. Top shelf stuff that, congrats to him.

Is vic sponge your favourite cake or do you just like the bad ones for some reason? Is this some pavlovian conditioning you have? Very confused about this choice. The rest of the rider makes perfect sense

I WILL. Waiting GP to respond to my application to sign up. I will bombarded them with snore recordings (that don’t contain much if any snoring)
[05/10/2023, 12:06:25] conall: Hahahahaha. They’re doing god’s work. Bless them. I wish I could’ve seen it
[05/10/2023, 12:10:25] conall: I’m going to ikea AGAIN but this time on my BIKE. I’m cycling the entire floop. Google maps seems to indicate it goes all the way to Ashton, very exciting stuff. I think I will pass through Gorton but I will keep my head down as to not ruin any possible future t-shirt data collection

Lastly, what time do you fancy meeting tomorrow? I’m done with work about 6ish so I can be ready for whenever after then. Leaving the choice in venue in your capable hands, consider me excited to see what Levvie has to offer
[05/10/2023, 17:31:45] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Agree. No holds barred tomorrow. Re arrangements: I should (theoretically) be able to get a bus from the end of my road that gets me to Lev for 7.30 if that sounds good? I will probs eat something at home before I leave. Venue wise, please can I list every bar in Levenshulme and have you choose the first one via NAME only. No googling, no asking your mates. Choose your fighter:

Station Hop
Overdraught
Isca 
Talleyrand
Nordie
Station South 
Fred’s
The Bluebell 

I think that’s all of them bar the scary Irish pubs
[05/10/2023, 17:32:30] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Naturally blaming you for any of the vibes that ensue
[05/10/2023, 17:38:42] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Victoria sponge is so far from my favourite cake. I just think the icing on a bad shop one is so reminiscent of silly birthday parties and me having a nice time that I gravitate towards them, just for that one slice. Still haven’t heard about your rider but appreciate you’ve had other things going on, such as IKEA. Do you live there???? Also sincerely hope you didn’t get caught in a slew of school kids walking home on the floop on your way back as I did the other day. You will have passed that park I’m always banging on about, very exciting all round
[05/10/2023, 20:17:09] conall: Wait, it’s no HOLDS barred?! I thought it was holes. Another Zoë bombshell drops and shatters my life to pieces. She cares not of the causalities.

This is a fantastic idea, I love it. Also you’re sidestepping any blame for a bad first drink. Played a blinder here with this. 

It’s between: Isca and Nordie. I don’t know why but they’re both speaking to me. Maybe it’s because they sound like they could be ikea furniture. If I can’t pick I’ll just flip a coin later on
[05/10/2023, 20:20:22] conall: Fair summary of your relationship with VS. I’d ask you your actual favourite cake but I know how you feel about the favourite vegetable question. Possible this is similar territory. I WOULD like to know though. If not favourite, one you like a lot.

Yes I still have no rider prepared. Very shit day at work today and the whole sleep deprivation thing really kicking me in the kidneys today. STILL working, unable to go to Boney-M. Very disappointing. I pray yours is more exciting than mine, or at the very least you have a lovely cat to stroke / almost throw up on you. Also how was the gig? Besides feeling OLD.

Ikea was necessary. I had no curtains, I have curtains now - I did order them a while ago but forgot to pick them up. Idiotic. I don’t want to go back to Ikea for a while, although the ride there is fantastic. Big floop fan over here, and no children! Not even a teenager. Stellar stuff.
[05/10/2023, 21:24:49] conall: I meant to say this before but was drawn away by work stressing. It’s National Poetry Day. I did try to figure out a “National Zoëtry Day” joke but it’s just not coming to me. I know you’ll say “Conall you’re doing the thing where you tell me about funny pictures but don’t send them, only this time in text form”, but I laughed at Zoëtry a tiny bit so I think it clears the bar
[05/10/2023, 21:53:27] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yes I think so??!! Although I DO have to search it to make sure most times before I use it because I’m also not confident. This is one of those things nobody ever perfects after hearing it in childhood I think, like I probably would’ve still been saying ‘dressing down’ for dressing gown until someone dropped that bombshell on me age 12 or whatever. I’m not sure if that analogy makes sense? I am tired, I also just got out of work, not loving this for either of us. I cannot believe you had to miss Boney-M, an insult to their legacy and it’s on your evil boss
[05/10/2023, 22:05:30] Zoë “cringe” Turner: You’ve chosen both the Scandinavian sounding ones. How interesting. Possibly is Ikea/curtain related, possibly a deeper reveal of you as a person though not sure what the reveal would be. Re cake question - coffee or carrots are my favourites. I often wonder if some kind of combination could be created. There’s my boring answer for your boring question
[05/10/2023, 22:15:03] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahahaha. This is funny only by way of how unfunny it is. Thank you for making National Poetry Day about me, if only in the confines of this text thread. I am going to collapse now as I’m back in at 9. Flip the coin and let me know - I can always meet you wherever you are getting off the bus/train/floop (so many options)
[05/10/2023, 22:16:31] Zoë “cringe” Turner: And I hope you sleep better tonight. Maybe curtains will help? It is exposing without them
[06/10/2023, 07:36:08] conall: Hahahahaha - a dressing down isn’t a bad name for it. Which reminds me I don’t have a dressing gown. Maybe decathlon will do them. I want to know other word mistakes that you have made in your life. I used to call a car park a “par cark” for way longer than I should’ve. Just couldn’t get the words out. Embarrassing really

Was the 9pm finish planned or did you get rudely called out? Sorry for that regardless of the source. That is a very long day, and you didn’t even have ikea to break it up.

I did tell my boss that I am missing Boney-M and he was remorseful, but he isn’t the CEO, he’s just a fella
[06/10/2023, 07:39:07] conall: Yes I’m unsure of what it says about me too tbh. My life has recently been invaded by umlauts so perhaps it’s just that.

Thank you for your boring answer. I won’t continue this thread, you’ve shut it down very effectively. Thank you for not asking me what my favourite cake is, I don’t really know and it would also be boring.
[06/10/2023, 07:40:06] conall: Hope you have some good sleep. Let’s meet at Levvie train station at 7:30 then we can flip the coin in person. I assume these places are somewhat near there (I haven’t googled them, as promised)
[06/10/2023, 07:41:51] conall: I slept better in some ways. Very broken, I woke up a lot but I did get back to sleep. Eight hours of very bad sleep is better than three. Big progress here.

Have a good day today, I hope you do the confusing free writing thing. That sounded fun but I assume it doesn’t come around often

[06/10/2023, 10:13:07] conall: change your name immediately
[06/10/2023, 12:16:11] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I wonder if anyone actually has this name
[06/10/2023, 12:16:12] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Anyway
[06/10/2023, 12:18:50] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I am looking forward to seeing you / asking you what your favourite cake is in person and watching you swerve it. ALL the bars in Lev are on one road, nothing to worry about there. Hope you have a good day also!!
[06/10/2023, 13:21:39] conall: ALSO looking forward to seeing you, Levvie, and what scheme I can come up with avoid cake questions. I’m thinking a multi-tangent smoke screen but I won’t give up my tactics completely. See you at the train station soon
‎[06/10/2023, 17:06:01] conall: ‎<attached: 00001066-PHOTO-2023-10-06-17-06-01.jpg>
[06/10/2023, 17:24:00] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I did think this earlier
[06/10/2023, 17:24:16] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ‘Is it wise making this decision in a cashless society’ was the thought
[06/10/2023, 17:24:28] Zoë “cringe” Turner: But that’s not even a REAL coin
[06/10/2023, 17:25:10] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Does it at least have two sides?
[06/10/2023, 17:25:18] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Like two different sides. Obviously it has sides
[06/10/2023, 17:25:37] conall: I have done my due diligence on the coin
[06/10/2023, 17:26:00] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahahaha ok ok
[06/10/2023, 17:26:18] conall: I was going to use the word “obverse” then. Don’t get many chances to use that
[06/10/2023, 17:26:23] conall: Maybe I’ll get to use it later
[06/10/2023, 17:28:25] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Oh my god
[06/10/2023, 17:28:29] Zoë “cringe” Turner: 1.
the side of a coin or medal bearing the head or principal design.
2.
the opposite or counterpart of a fact or truth.
[06/10/2023, 17:28:42] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This is why the Queen’s Nose is a lie ??????
[06/10/2023, 17:35:05] conall: who’s dropping the bombshells now .93
[06/10/2023, 17:35:23] conall: (.93 was meant to be Zoë)
[06/10/2023, 17:36:02] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Sick of people spelling my name wrong today
[06/10/2023, 17:38:00] conall: Hahahahahah
[06/10/2023, 18:01:43] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Is half 7 okay by the way? I just kinda said that because of the buses but I think I might Uber so can do later if that’s easier? I dunno what the trains are sayin
[06/10/2023, 18:08:39] conall: nah it’s perfect
[06/10/2023, 18:08:53] conall: getting on the 7pm BUS (controversial I know)
[06/10/2023, 18:09:02] conall: I should be there at 7:25. God willing
[06/10/2023, 18:37:02] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This is the decision of someone who believes
[06/10/2023, 18:37:10] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I used to be like you so I won’t take it away
[06/10/2023, 18:37:44] conall: Let me have my dreams
[06/10/2023, 18:40:04] conall: already made an error
[06/10/2023, 18:40:15] conall: overestimated the walk to the bus stop massively
‎[06/10/2023, 18:40:28] conall: ‎<attached: 00001092-PHOTO-2023-10-06-18-40-28.jpg>
[06/10/2023, 18:40:37] conall: it’s not for 23 minutes
[06/10/2023, 18:40:38] Zoë “cringe” Turner: By twenty whole minutes?
[06/10/2023, 18:40:52] conall: honestly I don’t even know what I was thinking
[06/10/2023, 18:41:01] conall: I’ve lived round here for 7 months now
[06/10/2023, 18:41:08] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’ve not even had a shower yet
[06/10/2023, 18:41:10] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahahahhaa
[06/10/2023, 18:41:12] conall: I know this walk is like 10 tops. Not half an hour
[06/10/2023, 18:41:18] conall: no need to flex
[06/10/2023, 18:41:24] conall: Very unbecoming
[06/10/2023, 18:41:33] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Whatever
[06/10/2023, 18:41:38] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Good luck catching the bus
[06/10/2023, 18:41:56] conall: THANKS I WILL
[06/10/2023, 19:01:57] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Has it arrived?
[06/10/2023, 19:04:22] conall: I’ve got 1 minute for it to be on time
[06/10/2023, 19:04:26] conall: 19:05
[06/10/2023, 19:04:30] conall: I still believe
[06/10/2023, 19:06:29] conall: okay belief is waning
[06/10/2023, 19:06:38] conall: I am opening uber
[06/10/2023, 19:06:42] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Sigh
[06/10/2023, 19:06:58] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I would give it ten minutes
[06/10/2023, 19:07:18] conall: I think I’ll be late then
[06/10/2023, 19:07:24] conall: not making a habit of being late to dates
[06/10/2023, 19:07:43] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Oh okay yeah I forgot you were quite far away
[06/10/2023, 19:07:58] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I think this is why you were 20 minutes early for the bus
[06/10/2023, 19:09:40] conall: oh dear
[06/10/2023, 19:08:15] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Don’t blame me for this complex though cause I never minded
[06/10/2023, 19:10:04] conall: no this is all my own doing
[06/10/2023, 19:10:14] conall: I felt so rude
[06/10/2023, 19:10:18] conall: Can’t happen again
[06/10/2023, 19:16:56] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahaha fine
[06/10/2023, 19:17:00] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Are you in one now??
[06/10/2023, 19:17:36] conall: No not yet
[06/10/2023, 19:17:54] conall: last one sort of Burmuda-Triangle’d on me
[06/10/2023, 19:17:58] conall: got another lined up now
[06/10/2023, 19:18:04] conall: 7:30 is my arrival time
[06/10/2023, 19:18:31] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Okie doke will order mine in a sec
[06/10/2023, 19:18:53] conall: Amazing to think I left the house 50 minutes ago
[06/10/2023, 19:26:25] Zoë “cringe” Turner: That is amazing
[06/10/2023, 19:26:27] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m on my way
‎[07/10/2023, 17:42:07] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ‎<attached: 00001132-VIDEO-2023-10-07-17-42-07.mp4>
[07/10/2023, 17:59:52] conall: I love so much about this
[07/10/2023, 18:00:05] conall: NOTHING is more important than the universe
[07/10/2023, 18:38:59] Zoë “cringe” Turner: As straight faced as my 2003 layers of croissant
[07/10/2023, 18:39:59] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Do not know how you’re functioning as you are day to day right now. I do not want to see people I want to go to bed
[07/10/2023, 18:40:14] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also I don’t have the heart to go through with the doughnut bit. Need provisions
[07/10/2023, 19:02:31] conall: I did google how many layers a croissant has. It’s not 2003
[07/10/2023, 19:05:15] conall: Yeah it’s quite awf tbh. Mark my words it will be sorted soon, your bloating has inspired me

Gonna get a thyroid test done as well - I kept notes of symptoms last time around and it does line up with what I’m going through atm (energy levels all over, sex drive fucked, no sleep). I wrote it off when you said it because I don’t feel panicked like I did last time, but I didn’t know what was wrong with me then so maybe that’s why. Great suggestion anyway.

Very annoying that this has happened when I’ve met you but thanks for being very nice about it all, I really appreciate it
[07/10/2023, 19:07:34] conall: Disappointing but ultimately for the best. A single donut plus 1/3 brittle of wine is really not what you should turn up with, bit or no bit. It would have been funny though.

Have a great night!

ALSO thanks again for such an ace evening / day. I’ve said it a lot today already but there’s nothing like a post-date “cheers pal” text is there
[07/10/2023, 22:54:17] Zoë “cringe” Turner: How dare you
[07/10/2023, 23:00:31] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I think that’s a good idea. Sometimes it’s hard to remember what having the thing felt like when you’ve had it managed for a while so this might make sense. There’s no need to thank me I just hope you feel better soon!!!! Also I know that you know yourself and your limits etc but I guess just try and be careful with yourself while you’re not sure what’s going on 🫶
[07/10/2023, 23:03:25] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Post-date cheers pal text is always nice for reiteration BUT I really love that you tell me this in person by the way, I think it’s super nice. You also know this already but I had a very lovely time. And your tiles are safe
‎[07/10/2023, 23:04:21] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ‎<attached: 00001144-PHOTO-2023-10-07-23-04-21.jpg>
[08/10/2023, 10:15:37] conall: It’s much much less than I thought, very disappointing tbh. I’d rather it be 2003
[08/10/2023, 10:20:22] conall: Very sweet message, thanks. I’ll try to keep myself in check this week, next weekend is a bit busy but beyond that I’ll keep things relaxed.

I went to bed at 9pm last night to test if that was the problem, turns out I just wake up at 2am if I do that. I’ve been up for a whole work day! Very stupid but I keep thinking “I only have a few more of these to get through until it’s over”, and that makes it all better

My sister-who-hates-me has told me that it’s because I exercise so much and actually it’s BAD. Unsurprising. The train to Blackpool was very fun
this morning, it was like the last chopper out of Saigon - filled with the dregs of an evening well spent in Manc
[08/10/2023, 10:21:35] conall: Very nice. I’m glad you enjoy it. It would be very weird if I only said it by text
[08/10/2023, 10:22:55] conall: This looks fantastic. I’ve never heard of pumpkin biryani but it’s really opened up my eyes. Very jealous of this meal.

Maybe I’ll try to stuff a meal inside a vegetable on Monday. It’s like the veggie version that stupid thing that americans do with 3/4 birds
[08/10/2023, 12:27:33] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I don’t know what answer you got but I got 55 and I’m finding that quite a pleasing, round number of layers
[08/10/2023, 12:35:53] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Oh GOD. Not the one at all. However I think it’s helpful to try these things so that you know how it’s working and have more data for the medical people as it were. This is a very good way to think about it, especially as it’s been sorted before if it’s the thyroid stuff! 

Hahaha. An interesting theory from the ever aloof sister. I remember you mentioning adhd too and I was with two friends last night who have this and they were talking about how they can’t sleep very well at all??? Idk if this is a helpful thing to say though

Wow what time train were you getting? I wish I could’ve seen the backwash. HAPPY INTERNATIONAL AFTERNOON TEA DAY. What a celebration. I want you to rate the afternoon tea by courses/trays please
[08/10/2023, 12:37:33] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It was really fitting for the springtime sun vibes we’re still having. But yeah there were walnuts inside the rice and I really enjoyed those. I don’t think I want to eat too many meals stuffed inside vegetables on the trot, it might ruin the novelty of it. But if you really want to I won’t stop you
[08/10/2023, 15:08:54] conall: Yeah I think the interaction isn’t a great one. It’s not so much in getting to sleep that it’s a problem (I have learned to tire myself out with tons of exercise), but if I wake up my brain is just HIYA. I do all the no screen blah blah stuff but it’s just how I am (/ how I assume others are with a similar brain)

It was the first one at 8am. Some very sorry scenes.

I am incredibly disappointed to tell you that IAT was not celebrated due to various illnesses that have been running through the family. No one could be arsed. I made a lasagne. It was very nice if I do say so myself.

Very annoying because I would have enjoyed rounding up the courses like I’m a bad TV chef
[08/10/2023, 15:10:29] conall: No that’s very fair. I’ll save the veg stuffing for another time.

On that note, I said to my Mum we’re watching Threads on Monday and she said that you’ll never want to hang out with me again if I show you that film. I said you’re not a simpleton. I think people who grew up in the 70’s/80’s are just hopelessly traumatised by it
[08/10/2023, 16:09:41] Zoë “cringe” Turner: They did say the same thing about waking up too soon rather than having trouble getting to sleep. Re sleep - here is that story that’s like ‘what if cities but nobody sleeps’. I just reread it, it’s funny in a slightly unnerving way and I think you’ll like it: https://www.thewhitereview.org/fiction/the-great-awake/
[08/10/2023, 16:11:14] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Upsetting BUT was it the many layers lasagne? Or just basic lasagne? Either way a good choice for everyone involved
[08/10/2023, 16:14:08] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahahaha. I appreciate your mum’s concern; she doesn’t know what I can and can’t tolerate. Maybe tonight I’ll read some letterboxd reviews of Threads in preparation, I bet there are some funny ones
‎[08/10/2023, 16:16:50] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ‎<attached: 00001157-PHOTO-2023-10-08-16-16-50.jpg>
[08/10/2023, 16:17:17] Zoë “cringe” Turner: There’s this and also lots of people who are probably younger than your mum who are calling it the most harrowing things they’ve ever seen
[08/10/2023, 16:17:40] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’d quite like an aftercare plan
[08/10/2023, 18:54:33] conall: just got back home. Nice sister dropped me off. Love that gal. Great chat. I’ll read the sleep story soon, funny and unnerving is right in my wheelhouse
[08/10/2023, 18:55:40] conall: just a basic one, didn’t even make the pasta. What a fraud I am! It was nice though. Excited for the baclavasagne (if you have a better name pls provide)
[08/10/2023, 18:56:48] conall: What’s your review of the reviews? My favourite are the really over the top ones where someone has put in tons of effort, they just wanna be Roger Ebert. It’s so cute
[08/10/2023, 18:57:11] conall: got given these today, does this suffice for aftercare
‎[08/10/2023, 18:57:59] conall: ‎<attached: 00001164-PHOTO-2023-10-08-18-57-59.jpg>
[08/10/2023, 19:15:50] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Extremely cute. And yes let me know what u think
[08/10/2023, 19:16:50] Zoë “cringe” Turner: And you say you ‘MADE’ it???? No as previously discussed even the most basic lasagne is hard work. I think you have the perfect name for the layered lasagne I will not intervene
[08/10/2023, 19:19:33] Zoë “cringe” Turner: They are sometimes cute, sometimes unbearable. Like I’ll be enjoying it but then I’ve already scrolled three times and I’m like NO I’m not reading an essay right now, I refuse. Also it’s got 4 stars so my review is: prepared to watch, mouth agape, will probably enjoy in a disturbed way. Type 2 fun film
[08/10/2023, 19:20:15] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yeah perfect thanks. Were these just M&S foodhall cast offs from your parents house?
[08/10/2023, 19:22:45] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Dog boyfriend is currently making a roast. I take it all back
[08/10/2023, 20:01:29] conall: I will! Nattering with my Grandma for a bit then I’m running a bath because I also got some epsom salts! The drink + mini whips were also part of this

Very cute. My family put together some little “welcome home” gift thing for doing the paris trip. I think sister-who-doesn’t-like-me sorted it out. Feel bad for dissing her. She communicates in strange ways but I think this is her way of saying “sorry I have been a bit of a dick”. Weird vibes with her all round today. Somewhat worrying. I’ll fill you in tomorrow if you’re interested
[08/10/2023, 20:01:59] conall: No very true. I feel buoyed by today’s lasag. Onward to great pastures.
[08/10/2023, 20:03:16] conall: I’ve laughed for a long time at type 2 film. You ARE funny as I have said repeatedly now (and I’m also not even that sleepy atm I think).

Yeah I sometimes go for the long ones as a sort of bit. “Go on this’ll be funny to read someone pouring their heart out”. I always get bored. NOT type 2 fun. Not even type 1 fun.
[08/10/2023, 20:04:05] conall: fantastic news, what a guy. Not to put a downer on it, but a roast is big “dog guy” energy. This could be a turning point though, looking forward to your review of both the conversation and the roast
[08/10/2023, 20:39:05] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This is such a hen party selection I LOVE it. And that’s so nice??? The story grows even more complicated. Conall of COURSE I am interested, you already know. But I hope everything is okay with her
[08/10/2023, 20:41:01] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Everything I do and/or experience will now fall into these two categories hahaha. You can try reading stupid reviews to me if you want, probs better than that poem about the beach you’re obsessed with
[08/10/2023, 20:43:23] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It so is isnt it. They’d been on a big walk prior to roast. I’ve learnt that his favourite radio djs are Radcliffe & Maconie, and that he finds Cerys matthews annoying. I think I know everything now. I’ve completed him
[08/10/2023, 20:58:25] conall: I KNOW. Honestly threw me completely when I clocked it was “from the family” (organised by her). So confusing. I too hope she is okay but our relationship naturally doesn’t allow me to know if she is or not. Very sad really. I’ll fill you in tomorrow, I’m sure you can’t wait
[08/10/2023, 20:59:10] conall: This does appeal to me but I’m not much of an orator. Maybe we can go turn by turn. Too much pressure having to entertain the audience alone
[08/10/2023, 21:00:17] conall: I assume these are BBC 6 people. I know very little of that station but it seems everyone ELSE listens to it. It’s a world I don’t understand.

Need to know how to the roast was. Don’t hold out on me Zoë
[08/10/2023, 21:27:02] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hm Hm Hm. I’m ready to analyse
[08/10/2023, 21:29:49] Zoë “cringe” Turner: What line by line?? Ok let’s go
[08/10/2023, 21:32:46] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahaha they are yes, I’m not really sure why radio 6 has become a part of so many people’s personality but it is very much my default. For context though R&M are the annoying dad joke men you don’t want to listen to on Saturday 

The roast was GOOD, I have no roast for his roast but I’m not a fussy person when someone is feeding me so whatevs
[09/10/2023, 03:59:39] conall: No I meant in person but I just kept that bit to myself very helpfully
[09/10/2023, 04:03:00] conall: It’s a good default from what I can tell. I have seen Craig Charles many times and apparently he DJ’s on there. I’m just so rarely in a situation where Radio is called for (unsure why I capitalised that but it’s staying). Me and Spotify are always thick as thieves. 6 can’t get a look in
[09/10/2023, 04:04:51] conall: also great news RE no roast roast.

I AM looking forward to seeing you later. I might be able to finish earlier than 5pm today. Even if you don’t come round earlier, always nice to finish early isn’t it.

What’s your plans for your day off? Other than traumatising yourself later ofc
[09/10/2023, 08:25:35] Zoë “cringe” Turner: He does, he’s funny. Sometimes when he interviews people he sounds really bored and you can tell he’s hating the conversation because usually he’s such an excited man, I like it when that happens. Do you never want to be free of vibe decisions??? That’s what Radio with a capital R offers me
[09/10/2023, 08:30:34] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Unsure why you’ve emphasised AM here as if somebody has previously challenged you on this but me TOO. That is always nice - just lemme know when you’re thinking you’ll be ready later, I’m pretty free today. I might see Robin for a bit beforehand but depends if she is feeling ill or not ill. The problem with having rando week days off is that me & Robin only really have each other in this
[09/10/2023, 09:33:34] conall: Love it. I’m surprised he can’t whack a fake smile on, he seems like the type to be able to do that. Odd I don’t listen to him really because he’s a great selector AND I like his voice a lot.

I’ve got too many decisions for vibes already made, I need to expunge them on a daily basis. Although spotify is often just a radio station without the occasionally annoying voices
[09/10/2023, 09:36:13] conall: Great capitalisation callout. I wanted to emphasise some bit of it to show that I am EXCITED, however I clearly got it wrong. Noted for future.

I think I’ll be good to go about 3ish it seems. Depends on how today goes but it’s looking pretty good for 3 atm.

ALSO got a GP appointment. ALSO ordered a thyroid / vitamin / general blood test. ALSO feeling good about this sleep even though I only got 4 hours last night. ALSO - well that’s it tbh.

Enjoy your morning. Catch you later
[09/10/2023, 12:24:40] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This is all GREAT news. Absolutely fabulous. Okay I think I’m gonna take myself on a walk possibly round one of the water parks because they’re on my mind so I’ll be in your general vicinity anyway
[09/10/2023, 12:26:39] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Do you want me to bring anything?? I’ve still got that doughnut
[09/10/2023, 12:57:18] conall: I’ve got stuff but the donut will do, and whatever low effort snacks you fancy bringing
[09/10/2023, 12:57:32] conall: actually I meant to say, do you like kimchi
[09/10/2023, 12:58:27] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I love it
[09/10/2023, 12:59:22] conall: fantastic
[09/10/2023, 12:59:29] conall: you’re in for a (possible) treat then
[09/10/2023, 12:59:53] conall: Shall we say get to mine for 4? I’m not confident in my ability to box this work off before then
[09/10/2023, 13:00:05] conall: 18 trafford mansions,
M16 0ED
[09/10/2023, 13:25:42] conall: AVTYALLT
[09/10/2023, 13:25:44] conall: one thing
[09/10/2023, 13:25:52] conall: limes
[09/10/2023, 13:25:56] conall: if you’re passing a shop
[09/10/2023, 13:26:00] conall: no worries if not though
[09/10/2023, 13:30:28] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I will get limes
[09/10/2023, 13:30:32] conall: nvm. A type 2 bag of limes has been found
[09/10/2023, 13:30:46] conall: we’re gonna be overloaded with limes
[09/10/2023, 13:31:07] Zoë “cringe” Turner: By type 2 Limes do you mean it’s just better if I get some new ones
[09/10/2023, 13:31:20] conall: tbh I’m not sure what I meant by that joke
[09/10/2023, 13:31:34] Zoë “cringe” Turner: hahahahahah
[09/10/2023, 13:31:55] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’ll leave the limes
[09/10/2023, 13:32:18] conall: one Threads please, hold the limes
[09/10/2023, 13:32:51] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also yes sorry 4 is good - although if I’m a bit later than 4 does it count as being late if it’s just at someone’s house? Or so late rules only apply to public meeting places
[09/10/2023, 13:33:08] conall: that’s fine, it doesn’t count as being late I don’t think
[09/10/2023, 13:33:32] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I thought as much
[09/10/2023, 13:33:40] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Houses = lax rules
[09/10/2023, 13:33:43] conall: I was going to say you could get here for 3 if you wanted, as I have just #DoneSomeGoodWork
[09/10/2023, 13:33:52] Zoë “cringe” Turner: In fact I think it’s more fashionable to be late to a house
[09/10/2023, 13:33:52] conall: however post-4 is also fine
[09/10/2023, 13:34:05] conall: you wanna wait until a few people are there first really
[09/10/2023, 13:34:18] conall: awkward if you turn up then it’s just you and some guy
[09/10/2023, 13:34:25] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yeah basically I don’t wanna be first to Threads
[09/10/2023, 13:34:45] Zoë “cringe” Turner: No I just don’t know what I’m doing, I need to leave the house if I want to walk
[09/10/2023, 13:35:00] Zoë “cringe” Turner: But I’m just sat eating fruit
[09/10/2023, 13:35:25] conall: eat yer fruit
[09/10/2023, 13:35:32] conall: anytime beyond 3 is fine
[09/10/2023, 13:35:58] conall: just give us a heads up so I can make sure I’m acting sufficiently nonchalant when you arrive (I’ll be eating)
[09/10/2023, 13:36:29] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This is what I was angling for you to say, thank you
[09/10/2023, 13:36:45] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Of course
[09/10/2023, 13:37:06] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Surprised to see your closest tram stop is Firswood. Never got off there before
[09/10/2023, 13:37:18] conall: what a day ey
[09/10/2023, 13:37:25] Zoë “cringe” Turner: What a DAY
[09/10/2023, 13:37:28] conall: kimchi, threads, new tram stop
[09/10/2023, 13:37:51] conall: really getting all the boxes ticked here
[09/10/2023, 13:38:11] Zoë “cringe” Turner: All my favourite things :)
[09/10/2023, 14:24:24] conall: just got another fave of yours
‎[09/10/2023, 14:24:46] conall: ‎<attached: 00001236-PHOTO-2023-10-09-14-24-46.jpg>
[09/10/2023, 14:28:47] Zoë “cringe” Turner: We can compare brands
[09/10/2023, 14:32:25] conall: I’d like to wait to do a long term review of mine. I was let down by the french, I don’t want to be hurt again
[09/10/2023, 14:51:19] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This is wise of you
[09/10/2023, 14:54:59] conall: right I’m DONE with work
[09/10/2023, 14:55:12] conall: both for the day, and in general
[09/10/2023, 14:55:59] conall: I am showering to wash the stench of labour off my body, then I’ll sit in a dark cupboard to await your arrival.

Enjoy your walk
[09/10/2023, 14:57:30] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Omg imagine if you did
[09/10/2023, 14:57:44] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Like I’d have to let myself in and press the on switch
[09/10/2023, 14:57:47] conall: yeah, imagine
[09/10/2023, 14:57:54] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahahahhaah
[09/10/2023, 14:57:56] conall: switch is on the left as you come in
[09/10/2023, 14:58:10] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Great thanks
[09/10/2023, 14:58:34] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m on the tram going to SWP, I’ll do a lap and then come back
[09/10/2023, 14:58:45] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I don’t really know why I’m still determined to do this
[09/10/2023, 14:58:54] conall: I like it
[09/10/2023, 14:58:59] conall: I’d like to join you tbh
[09/10/2023, 14:59:39] conall: howEVER
[09/10/2023, 15:00:02] conall: I have some admin tasks to do
[09/10/2023, 15:00:04] conall: kitchen admin
[09/10/2023, 15:00:08] conall: film admin
[09/10/2023, 15:00:20] conall: there’s a chocolate orange to open and eat a tiny bit of
[09/10/2023, 15:00:25] conall: important things going on
[09/10/2023, 15:00:31] Zoë “cringe” Turner: These things sound important
[09/10/2023, 15:00:36] conall: very important
[09/10/2023, 15:00:46] Zoë “cringe” Turner: also I think this walk is meant for thinking
[09/10/2023, 15:00:50] conall: thank you for understanding my position here
[09/10/2023, 15:00:56] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I think that was the original point of it
[09/10/2023, 15:01:07] conall: Yeah I’ll get in the way of that
[09/10/2023, 15:01:34] Zoë “cringe” Turner: we’ll reconvene
[09/10/2023, 15:01:36] conall: eat your fruit
do your walk
have your think
[09/10/2023, 16:11:10] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Ok I’ve done all above
[09/10/2023, 16:11:16] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Now I’m back on the tram
[09/10/2023, 16:16:15] conall: fantastic
[09/10/2023, 16:17:11] conall: it took me a stupid amount of time to find the front door the first time I came here, it’s down the left side if you’re looking at it from the road. You’re probably smarter about these things though so you won’t need this assistance
[09/10/2023, 16:20:54] Zoë “cringe” Turner: No I do tend struggle with these things also so thanks
[09/10/2023, 16:21:14] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Do you have a buzzer? Is it one of those
[09/10/2023, 16:21:33] conall: it’s one of those
[09/10/2023, 16:21:35] conall: 18
[09/10/2023, 16:21:56] Zoë “cringe” Turner: are you going to speak at me through an intercom
[09/10/2023, 16:22:22] conall: YES
[09/10/2023, 16:22:29] conall: first time I’ve done it
[09/10/2023, 16:22:34] conall: very very exciting for me
[09/10/2023, 16:22:48] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Ugh
[09/10/2023, 16:23:01] conall: I can come down to spare you the indignity
[09/10/2023, 16:23:05] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ok sorry I need to get on board
[09/10/2023, 16:23:14] Zoë “cringe” Turner: No no
[09/10/2023, 16:23:20] conall: hahahahaha
[10/10/2023, 08:39:59] conall: Hope you and your great face have a lovely day at work. Thanks for coming round, as ever I had a fantastic time, in case that wasn’t clear from my sleep talking
[10/10/2023, 09:55:05] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I love knowing that if you didn’t give these things away voluntarily, your sleep talk would just do it for you
[10/10/2023, 09:55:52] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I too had an excellent time and am looking forward to those flashbacks throughout the day
[10/10/2023, 10:36:58] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Lol oh my god I just met my mum’s pals partner and the first thing he said to me was ‘do you need those pronouns on your badge??’
[10/10/2023, 11:30:11] conall: I can only imagine how excited you’re going to be at work when you get a flashback to me talking about catholicism in south america. Hot under the collar doesn’t cover it
[10/10/2023, 11:33:10] conall: Fantastic. It’s like catnip to them isn’t it, absolute fish in a barrel. Part of me loves how excited the boomers get when they can go “oh you do THIS woke thing”. It’s their Christmas. Very sweet if you look at it in the right light, but obv eye roll central
[10/10/2023, 11:41:39] conall: I did make a joke about this, but I should say I am enjoying them also. I wish I had a better memory. Hope you enjoyed it as much as I did
[10/10/2023, 12:47:37] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This was the best part of the eve/morning I don’t know why you’re joking about it. The way you blended personal narrative with global experience? Fire emoji
[10/10/2023, 12:48:28] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahaha he DID get excited. Proper leant forward and everything. ‘Ahhh when was it built? Ahhhh do you reckon any of it was funded by SLAVERY? ooooooh imagine if you had to SHUT DOWN’ people are funny
[10/10/2023, 12:49:52] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I thought it was quite obvious how much I was enjoying things
[10/10/2023, 13:18:55] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also: had a prawn mayo sandwich for my lunch today.
[10/10/2023, 14:26:03] conall: Hahahahahaha I honestly don’t know how I got set off so easily. I’m not even that passionate about it although I have read some books years ago by various jesuits that I really loved
[10/10/2023, 14:27:00] conall: Top shelf stuff. You’ve really made his day. And I can say “his” confidentiality because he won’t be doing any of that funny pronoun stuff
[10/10/2023, 14:28:23] conall: It was somewhat obvious tbf. Many flashbacks. Great day today. Everything’s got a glow around it.
[10/10/2023, 14:28:41] conall: Great news, really glad to have you on board. I hope you enjoyed it
[10/10/2023, 14:30:28] conall: also this Armenian restaurant doesn’t do the dishes that I want (rude), but we’ll still go anyway because it looks nice.

Also gives a nice excuse for me to make the dishes that I want to eat anyway, I think you’ll like them. Lots of cheese and bread but also light palette cleanser-y things. Very good cuisine those Georgians
[10/10/2023, 18:11:37] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Can’t wait to see what the next episode of the podcast will be!!
[10/10/2023, 18:14:20] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Glow is the right word. Even though I am waiting for the one bus to Gorton that just will not, will never, arrive. Glow still exists. I wonder how it’ll influence your pottery shenanigans
[10/10/2023, 18:19:17] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Oh NO. Surely they will do items adjacent. Is around 7 ok on Friday??? I’m so intrigued, this is a cuisine that has passed me by entirely. Maybe I can eventually compare theirs to yours

[11/10/2023, 09:25:10] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I feelSICK
[11/10/2023, 09:45:15] conall: I had to rewind it three times to get that clip
[11/10/2023, 09:45:26] conall: and it didn’t get any less funny
[11/10/2023, 09:46:23] conall: also I’ve realised that I have three groups that talk about MAFS to me
- You
- Kate
- Dan and Iona
[11/10/2023, 09:46:28] conall: You’re all at different places
[11/10/2023, 09:47:26] conall: I’m taking it as it comes, but I HAVE spoiled multiple episodes for people now

[11/10/2023, 14:55:08] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahhahahaha how did I completely forget we did that
[11/10/2023, 14:55:20] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Stop going for food with me it’s so embarrassing !!
[11/10/2023, 15:01:45] Zoë “cringe” Turner: That wasn’t an INTENTIONAL meal though was it. It was like an ‘I have just cycled 9 hours help me’ decision
[11/10/2023, 15:02:42] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Re ripped trackies - my read is that this is acceptable anywhere EXCEPT Chorlton, so depends if you’re walking Old Trafford way or not right now sorry
[11/10/2023, 15:50:05] conall: Zoë it’s fine, you LOVE a third date meal. No shame in that. It’s a bit Sex and The City for me but who am I to judge?
[11/10/2023, 15:50:26] conall: well I’m in luck, I’m just finishing my free kick practice right now
‎[11/10/2023, 15:50:33] conall: ‎<attached: 00001326-PHOTO-2023-10-11-15-50-33.jpg>
[11/10/2023, 15:51:32] conall: I had to pretend to be a BIG united fan for this to be taken. Dream come true really
[11/10/2023, 16:12:04] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This is amazing but what ARE you doing there
[11/10/2023, 16:12:22] Zoë “cringe” Turner: When you said you were leaving the house with your brolly I just assumed a shop run
[11/10/2023, 16:24:00] conall: I went to the gym at the quays, had to WALK because my bike needs fixing. Didn’t clock how long it’d take me tbh. Really got my steps in today
[11/10/2023, 16:31:39] Zoë “cringe” Turner: A steps guy, a fragrant guy. Too many surprises today
[11/10/2023, 16:31:49] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also who did you accost for the photo
[11/10/2023, 16:39:47] conall: hey hey woah
[11/10/2023, 16:39:57] conall: I am NOT a fragrant guy
[11/10/2023, 16:40:03] conall: Putting that to bed right now
[11/10/2023, 16:40:38] conall: A woman who was clearly suspicious of me even though she was ALSO taking photos. Maybe she could smell the manc on me
[11/10/2023, 16:51:52] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I know you already tried to do this but I got it out again because I didn’t want you to think it had gone unacknowledged, nobody says their quinoa is fragrant and gets away with it
[11/10/2023, 16:52:20] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Really hope you offered to do the same for her
[11/10/2023, 17:14:31] conall: I think you’re just still sore after you’ve been caught out loving a third date meal, I know the game here
[11/10/2023, 17:15:56] conall: I did but her unfounded suspicions caused her to decline. She then took a selfie. Makes me worry I’ve got one of those faces the victorians said were prone to thievery
[11/10/2023, 17:16:39] conall: How is your curriculum vitae going. I trust it’s both fun AND stimulating
‎[11/10/2023, 19:56:16] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ‎<attached: 00001342-AUDIO-2023-10-11-19-56-16.opus>

[11/10/2023, 22:44:55] conall: EXCUSE ME
[11/10/2023, 22:45:23] conall: I had a whole plan for this, was gonna record a voice note back, take some notes about what you said. Whole deal
[11/10/2023, 22:45:28] conall: I get 40 seconds in
[11/10/2023, 22:45:32] conall: and WHAT do I hear
[11/10/2023, 22:45:47] conall: might not even listen to the rest
[11/10/2023, 22:47:34] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahahahhaahaha
[11/10/2023, 22:47:53] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Look I just had to speak my truth
[11/10/2023, 22:48:13] conall: it’s not honesty week Zoë
[11/10/2023, 22:48:18] conall: no one informed me of this
[11/10/2023, 22:49:34] conall: okay I have calmed down from this slight against my victorian thievery face and listened to the rest
[11/10/2023, 22:50:09] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I want to know if you have ever thieved
[11/10/2023, 22:51:43] conall: 1) You’ve really articulated what’s stressful about flat hunting. It’s WAY worse than dating. Every flat is your dream home. It’s awful. Let me know if you want me to help in anyway (not sure how I could do that tbh, but I WOULD if I could)
2) You deffo meant that pun. Need more bum info. Why is it bad. What are all the levels. What song were you signing
[11/10/2023, 22:52:34] conall: I’m not on trial here
[11/10/2023, 23:00:27] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Will you be my guarantor
[11/10/2023, 23:01:05] Zoë “cringe” Turner: If you be my guarantor your Victorian thief aura will be cancelled out
[11/10/2023, 23:02:07] Zoë “cringe” Turner: The bums are just BORING cause you have no lyrics you’re just backdrop
[11/10/2023, 23:02:43] Zoë “cringe” Turner: There are bottoms, bottom mid, top mids, tops, occasional top tops
[11/10/2023, 23:04:00] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Song = Only You by the flying pickets
[11/10/2023, 23:04:13] Zoë “cringe” Turner: For some reason this is one of our Christmas songs?? Is it a Christmas song?
[11/10/2023, 23:10:03] conall: yeah sure why not
[11/10/2023, 23:10:21] conall: you seem like a stand up citizen
[11/10/2023, 23:10:43] conall: you DON’T have a victorian thievery face
[11/10/2023, 23:10:53] conall: fantastic news
[11/10/2023, 23:11:07] conall: that is very dull
[11/10/2023, 23:11:22] conall: top tops! What are you again? Mid top?
[11/10/2023, 23:12:02] conall: Unsure of this but it did make me think of that other only you song, the Steve Monite one. Right boogier that
[11/10/2023, 23:12:11] conall: I will listen and get back to you
[11/10/2023, 23:13:52] conall: ah this one. I do like this melody. Not a christmas song. A 3 out of Christmas I’d score it
[11/10/2023, 23:26:39] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Thank GOD you think so, would absolutely hate to be one of these people, that would be so unfortunate
[11/10/2023, 23:27:26] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yes I am kind of non committal to either party
[11/10/2023, 23:28:30] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I had my suspicions. I missed the Christmas prep session that happened, maybe this choice was explained there but I didn’t want to talk about Christmas in September
[12/10/2023, 06:03:15] conall: It’s a moot point me offering anyway, I bet they wouldn’t even take me as a guarantor with my terminal case of VTF
[12/10/2023, 06:06:07] conall: Spotify (it’s like Radio but without Craig Charles being excited then not excited) has been suggesting Christmas playlists to me recently. I don’t know why. The closest I’ve got to Christmas songs is making myself sad with Boney-M recently.

Are you doing a Christmas gig with the choir?
[12/10/2023, 06:08:00] conall: Also, I just slept for 6 hours. 11:30 to 5:30. PROGRESS ZOË. PROGRESS. I am elated.
[12/10/2023, 07:21:09] conall: ALSO just remembered: show me the flat you’ve booked a viewing for!
[12/10/2023, 07:42:54] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Tbh all I keep imagining for VTF is that turnip on your wall
[12/10/2023, 07:48:02] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m not sure why it’s doing that either. Not even the Radio is doing Christmas yet. The more I think about it the more Spotify becomes the AI with the most potential to take us all over in this way. Which reminds me I want to see that new film about the robot child, I wonder if I’ve missed it. ERM I don’t know about Christmas gig because I haven’t been paying attention - tbc
[12/10/2023, 07:48:38] Zoë “cringe” Turner: AMAZING. Do you feel like a rested human being ???!!!! I’m very pleased
[12/10/2023, 07:49:16] Zoë “cringe” Turner: https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/86560101#/?channel=RES_LET
[12/10/2023, 07:49:38] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I think it’s been taken down because it’s probs maxed out on viewings but you can maybe still get an idea from the blurs
[12/10/2023, 07:50:02] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I don’t know why it’s so cheap but I suspect the lower ‘bedroom’ might be very small and windowless
[12/10/2023, 09:41:58] conall: Me to you: “great face”
You to me: victorian thief, turnip adjacent
[12/10/2023, 09:44:11] conall: Don’t get me started on Spotify because I will talk for even longer than I would about catholicism but I will not stop myself. Many many thoughts about it, lots of them BAD. Not the time nor format here though.

Ofc. I respect your lack of commitment to Christmas, mids and tops
[12/10/2023, 09:45:25] conall: I feel like I’ve been reborn. I am one with the earth. My week has already
gone fantastically but this has really tipped it over into a new area
[12/10/2023, 09:47:09] conall: I can see it without blurs, it looks good tbh. Very low price but tbh it might be because it’s wedged in a weird spot between the really rich bit and the other parts of Chorlton. Lmk how it goes, you’re meeting with your new housemate again today right? Feel like I’ve got that wrong
[12/10/2023, 11:31:17] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’ve dug myself too deep here. I don’t think your face is turnip adjacent Conall, ok????? Ok
[12/10/2023, 11:34:15] Zoë “cringe” Turner: There IS an episode two? Excellent. I love that you think all these bad things about Spotify and continue but that is just the hypocrisy in which we are caged I suppose. Caged like Viv. I’m doing a first year student high thought again here in case you haven’t noticed
[12/10/2023, 11:36:43] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I love this for you. How will you celebrate today??? 

This morning I realised that I’ve probably lost my fave leather jacket somewhere in Levenshulme / in the Uber we got home on Friday… and then I stepped out of the door straight into a huge pile of dog shit that somebody had left on our front step??? The gate was closed so I have no idea what happened here. Point is I’m maybe reverse reborn by this
[12/10/2023, 11:39:20] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Can’t believe it’s right off Barlow Moor rd though??? Let’s see how it goes. Chorlton massive. Yeah I’m meeting her there so even if it’s not great we can go and have a debrief and some frivolity
[12/10/2023, 12:31:32] conall: Oh there’s many more than two. They will all come out over time I’m sure. No doubt you have your own podcast, which frankly I’d be much more interested in listening to. Your voice is much nicer

You’re very good at stoner thoughts. You’ve got a talent for it. Shame you can’t put that on your CV
[12/10/2023, 12:33:26] conall: so far I have:
- gone to the gym / swim / run
- eaten 2 star bars
- made some non-fragrant quinoa
- gotten excited about a new coffee table we’re getting
- maybe fixed this problem at work but unsure
- organised a poker night
- possibly hurt my toe
- got a new bike seat

Very productive morning, and the day is only halfway through. I feel ALIVE
[12/10/2023, 12:35:01] conall: I am very disappointed RE leather jacket. When I think of you, I think of you in that jacket. It’s a part of you in my brain for some reason. Very sad day all round.

We can call round the places we went if you want? If you’ve just left it somewhere I’m sure they’ll still have it
[12/10/2023, 12:37:08] conall: I do support the move to Chorlton HOWEVER selfishly I was enjoying getting to know the sights, sounds and smells of Levvie. Swings and roundabouts. Also not everything has to centre around what’s best for me.

Glad you’ve made it frivolity status with your new roomie already. Are you checking in with them to explicitly point out the different phases of the new relationship in real-time? Maybe they wouldn’t find it as funny
[12/10/2023, 19:34:28] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m trying to get the 150, what are your bets
[12/10/2023, 19:35:45] Zoë “cringe” Turner: My podcast IS the stoner thoughts so prepare yourself for more
[12/10/2023, 19:38:05] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Starbar is such a rogue choice of bar, what is even in a star bar ??? The toe part really made me laugh but I do hope your toe is okay. God knows what else has happened to you in the last 7 hours (would, to be honest, relish another list)
[12/10/2023, 19:41:20] Zoë “cringe” Turner: That’s so nice but makes me more sad about it. We have a deep connection me and that jacket. I found it in Oxfam and it had the date of my 21st birthday on a tram ticket in one of the pockets, did I tell you that?? UGH MUST FIND IT. I might go into Nordie and Talley tomorrow and ask, think I can also try and contact the Uber driver somehow but I am not hopeful
[12/10/2023, 19:44:48] Zoë “cringe” Turner: We’re actually also doing so much checking in, I feel like checking in is just my new thing. I very much used to just hope for the best in a non communicative way but I am done with that approach. We haven’t even found anywhere and we’ve already agreed that I won’t keep any meat on her fridge shelves

HOWEVER the second bedroom in the flat was gross, a mere hovel. Ellen was quite good at moving things and nodding at mould too. The search continues
[12/10/2023, 19:47:01] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Oh my god IM ON IT
[12/10/2023, 20:04:56] conall: can’t reply cos pub quizzing (very serious) but I called Tally about an hour ago and they’ve got it. Obv you’re capable of this but thought you’d enjoy the element of surprise. I’ll reply to the above later and FUCK the 150
[12/10/2023, 20:12:41] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Are you SERIOUS
[12/10/2023, 20:13:02] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I appreciate this so much thank you
[12/10/2023, 20:13:33] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Would do happy cry emoji but can’t bring myself to
[12/10/2023, 20:14:29] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yeah don’t get caught with your phone out I almost lost a friend for doing this at a pub quiz once not worth it
[12/10/2023, 23:04:33] conall: god this quiz is so bad
[12/10/2023, 23:04:35] conall: taking forever
[12/10/2023, 23:04:45] conall: I just want a chip barm
[12/10/2023, 23:50:00] conall: I recorded multiple voices messages en route home, but I kept having to cancel them for one reason or another. I can list the reasons if you are interested, you do relish a list after all
[12/10/2023, 23:51:31] conall: Don’t worry about it honestly, literally took two seconds. It’s such a bummer when you lose a piece of clothing that means a lot, you’d have found out it was at Tally tomorrow anyway, I thought I’d try to shorten the search a bit
[12/10/2023, 23:51:50] conall: Fantastic. Very pleased about this. I love the stoner thoughts
[12/10/2023, 23:55:07] conall: Honestly am I single-handedly keeping the Star Bar brand alive? Literally no one’s eats them or has really heard of them at all. They’re fantastic.

Toe continues to hurt but only due to my own idiocy. Let me list up what has happened in the last 12 hours:
- Went for a climb
- Bought some PT sessions for my Dads birthday
- Went to a pub quiz with bad vibes
- Booked a venue for Seymour’s stag do
- Decided on my halloween costume
- Continued to cause damage to my already hurting toe
- Found your coat although didn’t really. I just called a guy
[12/10/2023, 23:59:14] conall: I love this. I feel like it’s sort of ironic-but-not-ironic (whatever the word is for that). At least for us anyway. It’s silly but also helpful. Why sod about assuming things, might as well just ask. It is also quite silly which I very much enjoy.

Very glad that Ellen seems to be on your wavelength too. Mould hunting is a vital skill. Do you see yourself being good mates?

Bummer about the flat but you’re in a good spot. You don’t need to rush into anywhere mega soon (dog man permitting).

Also very important meat separation chat. Good to get these things down early
[13/10/2023, 00:00:10] conall: Lastly, 7pm tomorrow. Habesha. As ever, I am excited. Enjoy whatever amount of sleep you get. I hope it’s at least 7 hours.
[13/10/2023, 08:53:49] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m pretty sure I got 10 hours sleep. If I get less than 8 one night I tend to just conk out for 10/11 the next. Do you think that’s too much sleep?? aware that I don’t want to be sleep-bragging. Basically I’m FINE and I hope YOU got loads of sleep. 

Yes tonight I am excited 😌however I have looked at the menu and there are just two things you can eat. Do you just get those on rotation whenever you go?
[13/10/2023, 08:58:25] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I want to talk about all the above later because I have too many questions. I’m guessing you didn’t win the quiz, I feel that would’ve been headline news. 

And yes I think so with Ellen! We seem to have things in common. Also I started doing that thing I do with my hands like when I kind of hit the other person’s hands across the table, I think you will know what I mean because I definitely did this to you but if you don’t I’ll demonstrate.
[13/10/2023, 09:02:40] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m going to Lev tomorrow anyway so I’ll march right in there and shout I KNOW YOU HAVE IT. I know you just called a guy (wonder if it was Tom lol) but it’s cut out a lot of fretting for me so I really am grateful. It’s gonna be hard to achieve but I hope your day is as packed and exciting as it was yesterday
[13/10/2023, 12:25:36] conall: I know you’re not sleep-bragging, but I won’t lie I am insanely jealous of your regimen. 10 whole hours?! I have to know your secret.

The times I’ve been I’ve only ordered those two things! They are both quite big though. Enough for two. I won’t complain if you want to get an animal in there though.
[13/10/2023, 12:29:23] conall: I know exactly what you mean and I found it very endearing when you started doing it to me. It confused me initially, I thought I had something on my hand that you were trying to get off. Later when you kept doing it (and I had checked my hand) I realised that it’s just something you do. I probably should have vocalised this at the time but it didn’t seem relevant.

Anyway, another milestone reached with Ellen. I look forward to hearing of more developments as they happen. Very pleased you’ve found someone you get on with, it’s not easy to do!
[13/10/2023, 12:39:07] conall: Very glad. The fret-cutting was my primary aim so this has worked out fantastically. I will tell you further thoughts about it later on (it’s just me being very stupid).

I’ve had quite a chill morning tbh. Work is a “hack day” today so I’ve pretty much just taken the day off. Went into town to meet up with my mate Dan (girl Dan not Oxford Dan, there are a lot of Dans). Iona’s dog is ill, so I bought a card and we signed it but pretended that it was written by the various dogs in our lives. Very millennial behaviour, Iona will love it though so that’s the important bit.

Enjoy YOUR day before you meet up with James (I think it’s James anyway, I couldn’t remember and I listened to your last two voice notes to see if you said it, to no avail)
[13/10/2023, 12:39:12] conall: no it’s Ryan! ffs
[13/10/2023, 15:33:47] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m pretty sure my secret is having lots of anxiety during waking hours. Also someone told me recently that women need more sleep than men? I don’t have the science but feels true 

And no we can have those things if they are tried and tested, I’m not constantly needing to eat animal all the time
[13/10/2023, 15:36:35] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahahahaha. I’m so sorry. I am kind of half aware when I’m doing it that the other person might not be that kind of tactile, but I always just cross my mental fingers that they know I mean good by it. If you had something on your hand I would just say what is that on your hand
[13/10/2023, 15:40:23] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Looking forward to your stupid thoughts. Also hack day sounds wonderful how often do you have those???? FREE day off? Very cute millennial behaviour from you both there, I feel you’ve used hack day well.

James will also be there!! You’ve said James because they come as a pair I think. James was in the gallery today and  texting me about my bosses scarf. I should tell you about the boss scarf anecdote/scarfgate, it’s quite funny
[13/10/2023, 18:25:11] conall: I will reply to these but using my real words instead of my texting words. Gonna set to Habesha in a few. Big big naps today. See you soon
[13/10/2023, 18:25:53] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Okay I am in a bar 15 minutes away
[13/10/2023, 18:26:03] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’ve already had two cocktails apologies
[13/10/2023, 18:28:44] conall: No probs, I’ve just had a 3 hour nap. It’s a similar level of elation for me atm
[13/10/2023, 18:31:53] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahaha great
[14/10/2023, 07:42:42] conall: no one should be in the city centre at 7:45
[14/10/2023, 07:42:47] conall: not in town with this
[14/10/2023, 07:43:34] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Is there a Friday night revellers/Saturday morning shoppers crossover happening
[14/10/2023, 07:44:29] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I told you the wrong stop for Oxford rd sorry
[14/10/2023, 07:45:56] conall: a little. I think i’m mostly moaning about the cold though
[14/10/2023, 07:46:01] conall: more layers required
[14/10/2023, 07:47:23] conall: I just got off at picc gardens cos I wasn’t paying attention, still feel like I don’t “know” the centre that well
[14/10/2023, 07:52:11] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Go and buy a jumper after your class, any jumper
[14/10/2023, 07:52:32] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m mad that greggs isn’t open
[14/10/2023, 07:53:12] conall: ANY jumper?!
[14/10/2023, 07:53:37] conall: right not to brag but
‎[14/10/2023, 07:53:50] conall: ‎<attached: 00001443-PHOTO-2023-10-14-07-53-50.jpg>
[14/10/2023, 07:54:38] conall: Although DF capital doesn’t open until 8:30, so I’m going to have to sit on a bench for a bit

We’ve both won, we’ve both lost
[14/10/2023, 07:55:49] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yeah go to bare necessities it’s so gross in there it’ll be funny
[14/10/2023, 07:55:55] Zoë “cringe” Turner: The bargain bucket is disgusting
[14/10/2023, 07:56:20] Zoë “cringe” Turner: :( I had to get a ginsters from Morrisons
[14/10/2023, 07:56:56] conall: updates to come later, looking forward to being a layers guy
[14/10/2023, 07:57:01] conall: utterly bleak
[14/10/2023, 07:57:19] conall: I hope the cleaners don’t hate you this morning, you don’t need that on your plate do you
‎[14/10/2023, 08:10:10] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ‎<attached: 00001451-PHOTO-2023-10-14-08-10-10.jpg>
[14/10/2023, 08:11:00] Zoë “cringe” Turner: They were okay today, I was unusually punctual
[14/10/2023, 08:12:07] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m sorry for stressing about the sleep thing and thank you for being so good about it
[14/10/2023, 08:12:16] Zoë “cringe” Turner: And thank you for being so magnetic
[14/10/2023, 08:12:19] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Etc etc
[14/10/2023, 08:12:44] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hope you’re having reflective bench thoughts
[14/10/2023, 08:20:33] conall: that is a sad sad pasty
[14/10/2023, 08:22:27] conall: honestly non need to mention it, we’ll get into a good groove with this sleep thing sometime soon. I have spent my bench time googling how I can stop myself sleep talking, apparently if you tape your mouth you just don’t do it lol. Unsure how I feel about that
[14/10/2023, 08:25:11] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Lmao we aren’t taping your mouth
[14/10/2023, 08:25:13] conall: thank YOU for being magnetic. I thought we were just gonna go for food, but it’s always nice to spend more time with you

I hope you manage to get through your day well. One thing that helps me is just calling things sleepy. I’ve just had a sleepy greggs, I’m about to do some sleepy teaching. Later, I’ll buy a sleepy jumper. It doesn’t make me more awake but it does make being tired a bit more funny
[14/10/2023, 08:25:16] Zoë “cringe” Turner: That’s psychotic
[14/10/2023, 08:25:34] conall: it is a bit isn’t it
[14/10/2023, 08:28:14] conall: They’ll come throughout the day I’m sure. You are great to spend time with in any capacity. I think I’m just too tired atm for any reflection / flashbacks
[14/10/2023, 08:39:00] conall: oh and lastly, you have also been incredibly understanding about my whole sleep thing that I’ve got going on atm. I know I’ve already thanked you before but it does stress me out a lot that I’m either not sleeping well and/or being annoying when I do sleep. You’ve been really empathetic about it though and I really appreciate it
[14/10/2023, 11:10:55] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I like this. I will call everything sleepy and just keep resting my head on things intermittently. Usually everyone at work is like this on weekends too so we just all sleepy together
[14/10/2023, 11:16:04] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Omg right, it’s so fine, I feel like I’ve really made a meal of this whole thing last night just cause I was panicking a bit. And maybe I’m not used to it right now either, it’s been a while. I don’t want my stress to be stressing you out when you’re also just struggling to sleep in general do you know what I mean??? IM SORRY. On Tues I think I’ll just go back to mine cause working Weds, but I’m gonna get some of those loop ear bud things cause I’ve been meaning to anyway for when I don’t wanna hear things like motorbikes at 7am, then maybe at the weekend we see if that’s any better ???
[14/10/2023, 11:28:47] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also hope sleepy teaching goes well ✨
[14/10/2023, 12:37:58] conall: It’s very effective. Hope your sleepy day is going sleepy well
[14/10/2023, 12:50:11] conall: Nah you haven’t made a meal of it at all. It’s good that it’s happened tbh. I don’t want us to end up in a situation where if we stay overnight with each other we both have a total write off of a day the next day because we’re knackered. We’ll get there. I’ve had more thoughts about this weekend too but they are weather dependent. I really do like the idea of buggering off out of the city for a bit with you. Are you free Saturday day time? I can’t remember if it was Friday or Saturday night you said you wanted to do something

Totally fine RE Tuesday, I was going to suggest that anyway. ALSO it’s kinda nice because it keeps sleeping together a bit more of a special thing. Easy to look at it like “oh this is bad we can’t do this” but lots of positives in there too. Thanks for being so nice about this all.
[14/10/2023, 15:41:57] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Did you see the double rainbow !!!!!!!!
[14/10/2023, 15:42:23] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Sorry will Obv reply just got excited
[14/10/2023, 16:18:34] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I 100% agree with all of this. Also I’ve ordered the ear plugs so I’m excited for the sleepomatic 3000 to retire. They’re so cute, they look like the kind of thing you wanna put in your mouth. I did have to lie down while listening to somebody’s tour today. Not my finest moment but I got through

Tell me all your weekend thoughts! Yeah I’m free Saturday day and night :) got a party on the Friday but I don’t anticipate being dead the next day
[14/10/2023, 17:22:41] conall: no!
[14/10/2023, 17:22:50] conall: ffs missed it
[14/10/2023, 17:24:39] conall: Sad to see the sleepomatic 3000 go but it sounds like it had a good run. Excited to see and NOT eat the ear plugs, no matter how tasty they look. I wouldn’t put it past that oaf Sleep Conall though. I’m sure the tour person would’ve understood, even if you weren’t tired you’ve seen it about a million times now
[14/10/2023, 17:30:21] conall: Weekend thoughts, I MAY be able to borrow my sisters car, which would give us a bit more latitude for where we can go. If the weather holds AND I get the car (two big ifs obv) do you fancy Yorkshire Sculpture Park? It’s a bit of a mish (hour or so), but I’ve been in yonks and I just love it.

Failing that, you mentioned Edale right? At least I think you did. Looked it up and it looks gorg, I’ve never been so we could just get the train there as you said. If Kate’s out we can whack some comfy clothes on, make some ramen and have a fantastic sleep after we get back
[14/10/2023, 17:31:50] conall: Enjoy your night with Nea (spelt that wrong almost certainly). Obligatory big apologies that you will be having a sleepy night with her. I hope you get your coat back though. I’m off to my mate Cass’ soon to have a drink or two before WHP tonight
[14/10/2023, 19:57:05] Zoë “cringe” Turner: YEEEAH I’d love this. I’ve literally been meaning to go for years and never have managed for whatever reason. What a great idea. But yes back up plan also sounds great. I can ask my friend for the walk she was on about the other day; I think it’s called Hope Cross but there’s no cross it’s just a cross road lmao. Also yes to ramen/comfy clothes etc, this would actually be made even better if raining
[14/10/2023, 19:57:40] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Feel like I actually already said that cross thing to you the other day and it wasn’t that funny then either hahahaha ignore
[14/10/2023, 20:02:31] Zoë “cringe” Turner: You are IRISH I can’t believe you’ve just spelt Nia like that. She’s also sleepy it’s fine, we have just eaten lots of Chinese food and she’s helped me plan my 2013 costume. Me and my jacket are reunited <3333 I walked in and was like do you have a leather jacket!!!! And he was like what? I think he thought I was looking to buy one
[14/10/2023, 20:03:14] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Have an excellent time tonight. I’ve only just clocked who you’re seeing, they’ll be GOOD.
[14/10/2023, 20:46:30] conall: I will reply properly to all of these properly but alcohol prevents me currently
[14/10/2023, 20:46:33] conall: HOWEVER
[14/10/2023, 20:46:43] conall: I will show you a jumper I purchased
‎[14/10/2023, 20:46:55] conall: ‎<attached: 00001485-PHOTO-2023-10-14-20-46-55.jpg>
[14/10/2023, 20:52:02] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Mmmm
[14/10/2023, 20:52:28] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Does alcohol also prevent you from taking a decent photo of said jumper
[14/10/2023, 20:52:48] Zoë “cringe” Turner: That literally could be anything
[14/10/2023, 20:52:55] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It’s giving pillow slip
[14/10/2023, 20:53:13] conall: it’s a jumper
[14/10/2023, 20:53:17] conall: I can confirm that
[14/10/2023, 20:53:35] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Not convinced but okay
[14/10/2023, 20:56:18] conall: unsure how I could take a better photo
[14/10/2023, 20:56:23] conall: I could take a selfie
[14/10/2023, 20:56:33] conall: but we both know that’s not what I’m going to do
[14/10/2023, 20:57:40] conall: getting in a uber en route to WHP so all I’ll say is I am EXCITED for play dough on Tuesday. Glad you’ve had a great night. SORRY again for the sleep
[14/10/2023, 20:58:05] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m just a bit like
[14/10/2023, 20:58:09] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Where are the sleeves
[14/10/2023, 20:58:12] Zoë “cringe” Turner: You know?
[14/10/2023, 20:58:22] Zoë “cringe” Turner: 2/3 of a jumper is in the sleeves
[14/10/2023, 20:59:38] Zoë “cringe” Turner: OKAY BYE I am also thrilled for play dough. Don’t worry I’m gonna have a mint sleep right now and that’s essentially down to you
[14/10/2023, 20:59:49] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Have funnnnnnnnnn
‎[14/10/2023, 21:06:46] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ‎<attached: 00001503-PHOTO-2023-10-14-21-06-46.jpg>
[15/10/2023, 09:20:22] conall: good MORNING

I had a very fun time reading all these texts yesterday. Prompted a discussion of sleeves. Great stuff all round

Hope you managed to get an absolutely massive sleep, I’m off to do this half marathon which I very very much can’t be arsed with
[15/10/2023, 11:24:40] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Good MORNING and good LUCK I hope someone is there to throw lucozade at you
‎[15/10/2023, 12:01:18] conall: ‎<attached: 00001506-AUDIO-2023-10-15-12-01-18.opus>
[15/10/2023, 12:10:13] conall: I literally laughed myself to sleep last night at this message. It’s like you’ve gone out to research the competition in preparation for Tuesday
[15/10/2023, 12:18:17] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Did you start saying something at the very end of this and then just stop? Hahaha
[15/10/2023, 12:19:26] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I bet you feel AMAZING. I just walked past a marathon man who looked defeated/dishevelled but I’m sure inside he was very chuffed. Did you get a good time? Whatever a good time is
[15/10/2023, 12:20:12] conall: I did!
[15/10/2023, 12:20:16] conall: personal best
[15/10/2023, 12:20:21] conall: 1 hour 43 mins
[15/10/2023, 12:20:29] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahahahah I just wanted to know what we actually have to do with the playdough and was pleased to get visuals
[15/10/2023, 12:20:45] conall: I am VERY pleased with myself
[15/10/2023, 12:20:53] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Fabulous !!!!
[15/10/2023, 12:21:15] conall: hhahahahahahahaha
[15/10/2023, 12:21:51] Zoë “cringe” Turner: You should be. On little sleep also I assume
[15/10/2023, 12:24:33] conall: yes not much sleep
[15/10/2023, 12:24:55] conall: I think I got back at 4:30ish last night but unsure
[15/10/2023, 12:25:08] conall: you working today?
[15/10/2023, 12:34:17] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Not sure how you’ve managed that at all
[15/10/2023, 12:36:29] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yeah but only til 4 and I have to make something for socials so I’ve decided to interview everyone about how winter makes them feel so maybe I’ll just do that all afternoon to speed it up
[15/10/2023, 12:37:47] conall: love everything about this
[15/10/2023, 12:40:31] conall: I WAS going to say I’m going for a post-run Rudy’s with Kate and a few others at 3pm, and you’d be welcome to come along (if that’s not weird? It doesn’t feel weird but idk maybe it is. Anyway if it is let me know)

REGARDLESS you will be conducting winterviews then so my fretting about it being weird or not to invite you is moot
[15/10/2023, 12:46:42] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Oh is this why you stopped mid sentence
[15/10/2023, 12:46:48] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahahaha
[15/10/2023, 12:48:09] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Not weird! And I love Rudy’s. But yes too busy winterviewing about winterblues I’m afraid, very important cultural work to be done
‎[15/10/2023, 12:49:15] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ‎<attached: 00001528-PHOTO-2023-10-15-12-49-15.jpg>
[15/10/2023, 12:49:49] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m panicking because I ate an entire Daim dairy milk that was in the fridge last night and I’m worried it was Aaron’s
[15/10/2023, 12:50:07] Zoë “cringe” Turner: And I can’t find it now, it seems rare even though Nia assured me it wasn’t
[15/10/2023, 13:08:24] conall: Okay very good. Didn’t want to come off like I was rushing things although unsure if “meal after half marathon with an assortment of people” counts as rushing. What a MINEFIELD

I am excited to hear more about / view the winterviews
[15/10/2023, 13:08:43] conall: not a fan of this, but I find it very compelling
[15/10/2023, 14:31:37] conall: also didn’t mean to skip over the most important texts, I fell asleep on the couch
[15/10/2023, 14:31:58] conall: Aaron seems like a guy who would very much NOT be cool with someone eating his Daim bar
[15/10/2023, 14:32:44] conall: I pray for your sake he’s off sanding his own floors today or whatever he does with himself
[15/10/2023, 14:33:30] conall: See to me this is a niche bar. I know you’ve dissed star bars before but the Dairy Milk Daim, that’s in another category of niche to me
‎[15/10/2023, 15:16:15] conall: ‎<attached: 00001537-AUDIO-2023-10-15-15-16-15.opus>
[15/10/2023, 16:17:08] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahahahahahah laughing so much at this
[15/10/2023, 16:17:31] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m about to ride home but here’s a video I saved for this opportune moment after you absolutely pied me for climbing
[15/10/2023, 16:18:02] Zoë “cringe” Turner: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CxvljfXshmM/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==
[15/10/2023, 16:18:10] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I think this is why you said no
[15/10/2023, 17:00:49] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I don’t know if that counts as rushing either but I understand the hesitation, a conversation for another day
[15/10/2023, 17:01:47] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I didn’t find a daim one, he can make do with a plain one if it WAS his and he cries about it. Let me know if you want me to send you my favourite Winterview of the day. Everybody loved the word winterview, thanks for that
[15/10/2023, 17:02:13] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Are you still going to blink 182 even though your legs and brain don’t work
[15/10/2023, 18:27:06] conall: I think you’ve hit the nail on the head
[15/10/2023, 18:27:14] conall: I do NOT want to EVER be a climbing guy
[15/10/2023, 18:27:20] conall: too many bad connotations
[15/10/2023, 18:27:49] conall: However bringing you along will be fun I have no doubt
[15/10/2023, 18:30:53] conall: I bet he’ll notice and I bet he won’t say anything to you, but he will mention it to Hannah and it will be a black mark against your name

and yes ofc! Please send it. Looking forward to sleepy watching it in my sleepy bed later
[15/10/2023, 18:33:01] conall: I AM still going. I would make a Blink 182 based joke here but I’ve just not got the memory for it. Something about the rock show, you’re smart you can put together something funny I’m sure

Brain is better after Rudy’s. Legs getting worse by the minute. I thank my stars that I got terrible seating tickets

what are YOU doing with your evening. MAFS + Juicy joggers I hope
[15/10/2023, 18:51:58] conall: also I have THREE layers on
[15/10/2023, 18:52:07] conall: really digging this life
[15/10/2023, 19:15:31] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I do really wanna do this eventually but, like when I couldn’t let you watch me take my inhaler, I’m a bit unsure about letting you watch me climb. What if I climb really weird
[15/10/2023, 19:16:52] Zoë “cringe” Turner: 😡he so would. I think Hannah would have my back and just eyeroll in that situation though….maybe
[15/10/2023, 19:19:01] Zoë “cringe” Turner: They’re only audio clips!! So this is essentially a 6 minute voice note from someone who is not me, but I DO awkwardly cut the convo dead at the end because I realise I have 10 minutes to send a big email and can’t talk to Oliver anymore. I think it’s good sleepy material actually
‎[15/10/2023, 19:19:19] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ‎<attached: 00001556-AUDIO-2023-10-15-19-19-19.m4a>
[15/10/2023, 19:26:06] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I can’t do Blink 182 jokes I’m sorry, I was never a fan so I don’t have the background information. Wouldn’t have got it even if you could make one. Have a GREAT time in your terrible seat and your three layers that you’ll hopefully be shedding inside who knows. 

I’ve eaten an entire aubergine, watching big brother cause I’ve ran out of MAFs and will probably be asleep soon. You’re really making me wish I had some juicy joggers
‎[15/10/2023, 19:42:08] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ‎<attached: 00001558-PHOTO-2023-10-15-19-42-08.jpg>
[15/10/2023, 19:42:31] Zoë “cringe” Turner: He’s scared of the fireworks :(
[15/10/2023, 22:53:06] conall: I didn’t realise you did the inhaler thing because you didn’t want me to see it. Very sweet behaviour. Don’t worry I won’t get the ick. Impossible at this stage
[15/10/2023, 22:53:51] conall: I am currently waiting for a tram. I’ll listen when i get home
[15/10/2023, 22:54:06] conall: actually
[15/10/2023, 23:26:28] conall: fantastic news. I didn’t send that last message
[15/10/2023, 23:26:36] conall: just woke up in east dids
[15/10/2023, 23:26:53] conall: the tram doesn’t wake you up if you fall asleep as it turns out
[15/10/2023, 23:27:34] conall: this message was a sleepy conall / drunk conall colab. Very effusive about you. Glad it wasn’t aired.
[15/10/2023, 23:36:33] conall: ALSO
[15/10/2023, 23:36:42] conall: great new pic
[15/10/2023, 23:36:49] conall: you look like you’re having lots
of fun
[15/10/2023, 23:36:52] conall: big fan
[16/10/2023, 08:03:13] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Ahhhhhh!! Lol - did you get home ok???
[16/10/2023, 08:07:04] conall: Yeah managed it in the end, although I did get off at Chorlton and walk to my old place before realising that I don’t live there anymore. I am a broken man
[16/10/2023, 08:12:57] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahaha don’t give me broken man, you did TOO many activities and I am very unsurprised your head was falling off
[16/10/2023, 08:13:39] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also: why else would I have done this, in case it didn’t work when perceived? Also DONT curse the ick. The ick could strike at any moment with no regard for anyone’s feelings
[16/10/2023, 08:14:06] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Upset that I didn’t get this
[16/10/2023, 08:15:11] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Pint in hand, uniqlo bag on, summer breeze. What else does a girl need
[16/10/2023, 08:18:59] conall: I demand sympathy for being in the hole I have thrown myself in!
[16/10/2023, 08:23:31] conall: I don’t know! It’s just an inhaler. How bad could it be. If anything I am only more intrigued now. Mark my words I will witness this

I have many thoughts on the ick. Podcast thoughts, but I won’t subject you to that now. The docket is fit to burst
[16/10/2023, 08:26:49] conall: Drunk Conall was really going for it, Sleepy Conall stepped in to shut it all down and take me to East Dids. I can’t even remember what I said now but I assume it would’ve been a genuine expression of feelings (cringe)
[16/10/2023, 08:29:35] conall: Need an update from you on the following:
- dog based social networking
- dairy milk gate
- big brother
- generally how you are cos that’s always nice to know isn’t it
[16/10/2023, 09:40:47] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I refuse!
[16/10/2023, 09:41:58] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I wanna discuss the ick also. It’s such a phenomenon, I do think we have all made it up. Also I have a good ick someone gave me to demonstrate
[16/10/2023, 09:43:13] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahahaha, being taken to East Dids for being too effusive sounds like that whole idea of being sent to Coventry. I think it’s more cringe because I’m imagining your drunk head on the window of an otherwise empty tram
[16/10/2023, 09:46:27] Zoë “cringe” Turner: - Dog: whatever, it’s just there now
- nobody cared about the dairy milk, I maybe blew that all out of proportion
- Farida has been voted off big brother and played ‘I don’t care’ very well. The whole show has got me wondering what I’d be voted off for, like what would my worst traits be in a house with 20 people. Big question
- I’m good! I’m on my way to Todmorden to walk with James, it’s a very nice day, I’m glad I’m off
- how are YOU apart from broken?
[16/10/2023, 12:46:21] conall: Can’t wait to hear this. I’m unsure if I’ve ever got the ick, but I’ll end up podcasting if I go on. We will discuss LATER
[16/10/2023, 12:47:45] conall: I don’t get the Coventry reference I’ll be honest, all I know about it is that it got bombed a lot. I’m sure it’s lovely enough though.

Yes yes very funny. Everyone laugh at Sleepy Conall, he is an oaf
[16/10/2023, 12:52:36] conall: Unsure what “I don’t care” is but I would like to find out. Big Brother sounds legitimately good but I’m yet to watch an episode. Maybe we can watch some on Saturday unless Volcanos take priority.

That sounds like a gorg day. I hope you two are having fun. I’ve never been to Tod but I think it’s near the bridge place that’s the lesbian capital of the UK, or maybe I’m just making that up? Regardless enjoy Tod and James

Slowly repairing myself. Brain showing signs of life. Legs very sore but hopefully pilates and a steam later on will sort that out. Definitely should’ve taken today off

TWO new jumpers acquired. I’m a layers guy now
[16/10/2023, 14:59:33] Zoë “cringe” Turner: You’ve never got the ick? Fascinating. Can’t wait to discuss. On that note, can I just come to Chorlton straight from work tomoz to meet ya?
[16/10/2023, 15:00:54] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It’s just an idiom about being cast out, I think it comes from the bombing thing, doesn’t matter, irrelevant. I will not be sending sleep Conall to metaphorical Coventry or to anywhere else
[16/10/2023, 15:02:52] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahahah sorry I said that like ‘I don’t care’ is a game, it’s not a game she was just pretending to be nonchalant, EXCITED even, about leaving the house. I do think you would enjoy it, let’s add it to our many options wheel

[16/10/2023, 15:08:04] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Can’t believe you’ve gone from 0 jumpers to 3 in a matter of days. That’s such good layers work, congrats. Hope they all have sleeves.
[16/10/2023, 16:36:32] conall: course, we can make some grub before we head to font. Unsure of what time the quiz starts but I assume it’s 7ish or later
[16/10/2023, 16:36:52] conall: East dids was already enough of a shock, I think Coventry would really send me over the edge
[16/10/2023, 16:42:00] conall: Love this pic, completely enamoured by it. Great calf/face combo. No notes
[16/10/2023, 16:43:00] conall: ALSO I was going to ask for pics of your day but you sent them anyway. What a result. Glad you had a fun time
[16/10/2023, 16:43:44] conall: Who knew being a layers guy was just £15 and two charity shop visits away? I’ve worn two different jumpers today. What a life. Thanks for opening my eyes
[16/10/2023, 16:49:03] conall: I also need to find a bomber jacket for a halloween costume. I have had zero luck in the two charity shop visits. I think it’s a bomber jacket anyway, I don’t really know jackets (I know you’ll say I have to know jackets to be a layers guy but baby steps okay)
[16/10/2023, 16:49:49] conall: What’re you and James up to later..:::….:::.!:&;£;!
[16/10/2023, 16:50:09] conall: wet phone
[16/10/2023, 17:47:58] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It starts at 8 (I did my research if you recall). That sounds NICE
[16/10/2023, 17:48:21] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Now imagine I’m reading the two headed calf poem off cam
[16/10/2023, 17:50:12] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m SO excited to see them. When jumpers are a new concept there are so many possible vibes to go for, I wanna know what yours is
[16/10/2023, 17:53:15] Zoë “cringe” Turner: What is the costume??? Tell me and I can look for the right kind of jacket on Vinted. This is where I’m trying to source the right Peter Pan collar dress for my birthday (I’m going as Alexa Chung on the cover of the book she released called It, such a moment for so many weirdly obsessed fans like myself 10 years ago)
[16/10/2023, 17:54:06] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’ve come home to look at flats and do some work or something. I did want to stay at theirs but didn’t think ahead and bring my stuff, NVM
[16/10/2023, 19:25:38] conall: of course of course. I thought you might have restricted the research to play-dough only (is it play-doh? i feel like it is)
[16/10/2023, 19:26:15] conall: That poem had completely left my head, likely on account of how confusing it is. Even now I am unable to recall it. It’s no footsteps in the sand that’s for sure
[16/10/2023, 19:26:44] conall: Tbh, not the exact vibes I was after but it’s charity shops init. Looking forward to you vibe checking me tomorrow
[16/10/2023, 19:27:42] conall: Let me find a pic. The theme is “film characters but the opposite gender”. I’m going with Ridley from Alien 3 because she shaves her head in that one. Crap film but WHATEVER
[16/10/2023, 19:28:10] conall: I wanna see these flats
Won’t get none of your cd’s back

[16/10/2023, 19:29:51] conall: Went to pilates with my sister now my legs hurt less. Weird how that works. Off to get some fish and chips, I think it’s what my brain needs to reboot
[16/10/2023, 20:03:58] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I think you’re right about the doh thing. Also am I remembering accurately that it tastes quite nice? Will try not to eat it in your presence regardless. Was supposed to finish at 5 but it has transpired that I need to lock up tomorrow and depending on how annoying staff are being about getting out of the building this could set me back a little bit, I’ll keep you posted anyway
[16/10/2023, 20:07:15] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Charity shop vibes are my favourite vibes unless you’ve gone completely off piste in a Sue Ryder
[16/10/2023, 20:10:09] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Bomber confirmed although it IS hard to tell when she’s wearing it so nonchalantly. Also is it brown??
[16/10/2023, 20:11:47] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’ve never tried Pilates but I’m very glad the rumours are true. Are you going to that good chippy near the postbox shawarma place? I had chips from there pre viewing the other day and colour me impressed
[16/10/2023, 20:35:06] conall: I find the smell revolting but maybe it’s a genes thing like the coriander soap deal. No worries about being a bit late, we’ve got loads of time thanks to your research, so we can accept some amount of staff annoyance
[16/10/2023, 20:35:36] conall: I DID go in Sue Ryder. I have kept it very much on piste, if you’re allowed to say that
[16/10/2023, 20:38:30] conall: I think it’s black but the light is giving it brown vibes, and she isn’t wearing it THAT nonchalantly, she isn’t eating anything

Also show me the Alexa Chung pic, you’ve mentioned it before but it’s not a cultural touchstone for me I’m sorry to say
‎[16/10/2023, 20:40:55] conall: ‎<attached: 00001621-AUDIO-2023-10-16-20-40-55.opus>

[17/10/2023, 07:11:57] conall: I have zero idea what the Ian Beel reference is I’m afraid. I would like to be clued in.

I think I’m good for a quiz, but appreciate you saying that. I hopefully won’t drag you down too much, I am still a little sleepy even though I’ve had NINE hours sleep. But also I’ve just woke up so maybe I just need to get going.

RE vinted, didn’t realise bombers were ten a penny - very nice of you to look regardless. I need to find an olive vest too but I think I can just order that off amazon. Not a vest guy but suns out guns out as they say.

Do you want me to cause a scene outside at 5pm today? Thus might lure the director out (unless they earn SO much money that they are above rubber-necking)
[17/10/2023, 07:17:55] conall: I think you’ll look fantastic like this. Can’t see the Kermit collar (I think it was Kermit?) but maybe whatsapp has ruined the quality. Great choice of costume

LASTLY I was idly singing some John Cooper Clarke poem (the only poetry I and many others have ever listened to) and apparently Arctic Monkeys did a cover of it? You’re their biggest fan so I assume you’d already know this. I’ll have to start singing Evidently Chickentown instead so I don’t seem like an AM super fan
[17/10/2023, 07:20:21] conall: I hope you got your 14 hours of sleep or whatever incredible amount you needed. That sounds arsey but I’m very jealous about the fact that there are people out there who can just sleep without much fanfare. How do they do it?!

Have a great day
[17/10/2023, 12:37:20] Zoë “cringe” Turner: What are your thoughts on pre quiz food ?? Asking now in case I can get anything from Lidl on my lunch - I found a recipe for paneer curry that looks NICE but I don’t know if it might be a bit fiddly
[17/10/2023, 12:37:37] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also forgot to screenshot it and now NYT won’t let me see it
[17/10/2023, 12:37:49] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Maybe u can

[17/10/2023, 13:59:34] conall: Sorry big naps about today
[17/10/2023, 14:00:10] conall: https://archive.md/kF2Qf

found it archived
[17/10/2023, 14:01:07] conall: It does look nice this. My plan was to use the freezer-y stuff (I’ve got a load of gyoza and bao buns)

but that’s not really in the spirit of “let’s cook a nice meal together”
[17/10/2023, 14:04:23] conall: I can get the stuff for this in a bit, I’ve got all the spices. Just need the paneer, ginger and an onion

Are you a bread or rice person with curry? I’m in camp bread but happy to change if you’re a ricer
[17/10/2023, 14:06:13] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Jealous
[17/10/2023, 14:06:57] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I mean we won’t have massive amounts of time so I don’t really mind either way, I will leave it in your hands. It depends on my mood, today I am thin bread vibes
[17/10/2023, 14:07:24] conall: Fantastic news all round
[17/10/2023, 14:07:38] conall: I’ll aim to have it ready by 7
[17/10/2023, 14:08:16] conall: If you turn up earlier then you can help out but if not it’s easy street for you this eve
[17/10/2023, 14:09:53] Zoë “cringe” Turner: That would be wonderful thank you, hoping I’ll be there by 6.30 if not before
[17/10/2023, 14:09:59] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I hope you’re feeling better??
[17/10/2023, 14:13:16] conall: Yeah feeling great! Bit tired still but excited about this evening. Had a really good morning at the docs getting loads of tests done. I’ll bore you with the details later on. Soon enough you’ll get to know non-sleep deprived Conall
[17/10/2023, 14:16:35] conall: Also hope you’re feeling well obv too, what with the various ailments we have between us
[17/10/2023, 14:18:38] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Great news!! You actually got more sleep than me last night and I dunno if that’s happened the whole time I’ve known you. Buzzing
[17/10/2023, 14:20:50] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I am fineeee a bit sleepy and head pressurey but also excited for later and if you DO want to start a riot outside work feel free, I would like to leave
[17/10/2023, 14:39:55] conall: I am very pleased about this but not because I’ve won sleep, it’s mostly because you’re very good at it. Thank you for telling me this I am very pleased with myself
[17/10/2023, 14:40:55] conall: Well I’ll reiterate what you said to me, we CAN just chill at mine if you want. Kate’s out so we can just have some grub and watch some big brother or something then you can head off for an early night. No pressure to do the silly doh quiz
[17/10/2023, 16:28:50] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It’s because you’ve won sleep isn’t it
[17/10/2023, 16:29:00] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Let’s just see how we feelin!!
[17/10/2023, 17:27:52] conall: just jumping in the shower cos I’m covered in bike filth
[17/10/2023, 17:28:25] conall: I’ll be able to jump out if you get here in the next 10 or so
[17/10/2023, 17:39:22] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahaha
[17/10/2023, 17:39:32] Zoë “cringe” Turner: No don’t worry I’ve just left work
[17/10/2023, 17:48:06] conall: Fantastic
[17/10/2023, 17:48:18] conall: I’ve got all the food set up for cooking
[17/10/2023, 17:48:27] conall: it’s like Saturday Morning Kitchen in this flat
[17/10/2023, 17:48:45] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Is everything set up in separate little bowls
[17/10/2023, 17:48:59] conall: YES
[17/10/2023, 17:49:01] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Cause I’m not coming if it isn’t x
[17/10/2023, 17:49:13] Zoë “cringe” Turner: GREAT
[17/10/2023, 17:49:16] conall: Literally my favourite thing about cooking
[17/10/2023, 17:49:19] conall: Honestly these bowls
[17/10/2023, 17:49:23] conall: best £10 I ever spent
[17/10/2023, 17:49:46] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Excellent
[17/10/2023, 17:49:48] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m so hungry
[17/10/2023, 17:50:10] conall: this won’t take long
[17/10/2023, 17:50:16] conall: about 20/25 mins I think
[17/10/2023, 17:50:26] conall: I have other snacks if you’re dezzie
[17/10/2023, 17:50:56] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Dezzie
[17/10/2023, 17:51:05] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Haven’t heard that in a while
[17/10/2023, 17:51:10] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Love it though
[17/10/2023, 17:51:55] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I just dodged walking to the bus with a girl at work everyone avoids for justified reasons
[17/10/2023, 17:53:19] conall: great start to a great evening
[17/10/2023, 17:53:20] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Now I’m on the bus
[17/10/2023, 17:53:24] conall: it can only get better from here
[17/10/2023, 17:53:25] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Success all round
[17/10/2023, 17:53:32] conall: keep these wins coming
[17/10/2023, 17:53:45] conall: I’m just sort of
[17/10/2023, 17:53:48] conall: stood in the kitchen
[17/10/2023, 17:53:49] Zoë “cringe” Turner: bus has really tall seats for some reason
[17/10/2023, 17:53:54] conall: unsure what to do with myself
[17/10/2023, 17:53:57] Zoë “cringe” Turner: But enjoying it so that’s a win
[17/10/2023, 17:54:05] Zoë “cringe” Turner: hahahaha
[17/10/2023, 17:54:09] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Liminal space
[17/10/2023, 17:54:18] conall: might open a book I’ll never read halfway so I look learned when you arrive
[17/10/2023, 17:54:29] conall: “oh this? The Iliad?”
[17/10/2023, 17:54:38] Zoë “cringe” Turner: You mean exactly like Ken in Barbie
[17/10/2023, 17:54:49] conall: surely he didn’t come up with that bit
[17/10/2023, 17:54:56] conall: I feel like that bits evergreen
[17/10/2023, 17:55:03] conall: Maybe I am just channeling Ken
[17/10/2023, 17:55:17] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Maybe you are
[17/10/2023, 17:55:23] conall: I don’t have any books on horses though
[17/10/2023, 17:55:26] conall: or whatever he was reading
[17/10/2023, 17:56:02] Zoë “cringe” Turner: nah it was definitely the Iliad
[17/10/2023, 17:56:14] conall: oh lol really
[17/10/2023, 17:56:27] conall: wow didn’t realise I was biting Ken’s style so much
[18/10/2023, 00:57:06] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I am home
[18/10/2023, 00:57:18] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Such a smooth drive, loved him. 5 stars
[18/10/2023, 00:57:44] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Thanks for tonight it was lovely even sans quiz
[18/10/2023, 00:58:26] conall: already?!
[18/10/2023, 00:58:40] conall: I’ve barely got up the stairs
[18/10/2023, 01:03:32] conall: Very excited for sleeping and other activities on Saturday, I have a good feeling about it. Thanks for generally being open about yourself, it seems like a small thing but you’ve obviously done a lot of work on yourself and it shows when you chat about your life up to now. It’s very refreshing I guess. Anyway not a convo for now. 

Have a good sleep! Chat soon x (not ironic)
[18/10/2023, 01:14:16] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ME TOO, and also thank you for demanding I go home this evening, I know I might have been sulking at the time but I am actually very grateful for that. And that’s absolutely no problem I’m generally very big on laying cards out, mainly because I enjoy being understood. Lol. Thank you for also being a copy of mice and men with dead Lenny on the cover. Gooooood night xoxoox
[18/10/2023, 07:18:00] conall: I’m obviously TERRIBLE at horny texting with someone new so forgive my stilted manner
[18/10/2023, 07:18:34] conall: But christ can you get out of my head for one second please. I have work to do! I can’t walk around this hard all day. It’s completely unworkable
[18/10/2023, 07:32:28] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I mean
[18/10/2023, 07:32:39] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I absolutely hope I stay there
[18/10/2023, 07:32:51] Zoë “cringe” Turner: (there being in your head)
[18/10/2023, 07:33:19] Zoë “cringe” Turner: A strange turn of events for someone who DOESNT get flashbacks
[18/10/2023, 07:33:39] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Not a horny picture incoming but doesn’t the bruise look like it has a disgruntled face
‎[18/10/2023, 07:33:48] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ‎<attached: 00001711-PHOTO-2023-10-18-07-33-48.jpg>
[18/10/2023, 07:33:59] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It’s like a tired grumpy egg
[18/10/2023, 07:34:00] conall: hahahahahahahaha
[18/10/2023, 07:34:23] conall: I literally about to say it looks like Humpty Dumpty
[18/10/2023, 07:34:40] conall: Amazed you have no idea how you did that
[18/10/2023, 07:35:16] conall: It looks like you got hit with a cricket bat
[18/10/2023, 07:35:55] conall: I did I assume I just never acknowledged them as such, now they have a name they’re all over the place
[18/10/2023, 07:36:44] conall: I have VERY important work to do! Can’t be sitting in the office (my room) like this
[18/10/2023, 08:15:38] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Told you sleep Conall has no idea what he’s doing
[18/10/2023, 08:17:08] Zoë “cringe” Turner: You should keep me in your head if you do something about it
[18/10/2023, 08:17:32] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Wouldn’t wanna distract you ALL day
[18/10/2023, 09:06:35] Zoë “cringe” Turner: now I’m in work I am also struggling with this
[18/10/2023, 09:42:24] conall: Things HAVE been done, it hasn't helped
[18/10/2023, 09:43:56] conall: There was no ironic x after this but I feel like this statement wasn't entirely sincere
[18/10/2023, 09:44:11] conall: Fantastic. I hope your day is as frustrating as mine is
[18/10/2023, 11:01:27] Zoë “cringe” Turner: UGH x
[18/10/2023, 14:55:10] conall: Right I will stop horny texting now because there’s only so much you can do in a day but this hasn’t left my brain ALL day
[18/10/2023, 14:55:48] conall: ALSO you left your ear ring cork here
[18/10/2023, 16:02:26] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Literally same
[18/10/2023, 16:02:41] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Last night was very good
[18/10/2023, 16:03:05] Zoë “cringe” Turner: My earring CORK
[18/10/2023, 16:47:12] conall: It was, you’re fantastic. I feel like I’m learning loads about what you like every time, every new thing just sends me off the deep end
[18/10/2023, 16:47:27] conall: ANYWAY it almost hurts to be this horny for this long and be unable to do anything about it. For my own sanity I’m going to have to stop talking about this now. Please be nice I have meetings until 7 today
[18/10/2023, 16:47:40] conall: I don’t know what these things are called! Stopper? End?
[18/10/2023, 17:15:58] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This feels like half invitation half deadly serious so I will avoid detailing what I have been extremely busy thinking about at this stage
[18/10/2023, 17:16:19] Zoë “cringe” Turner: But I would like this to carry on
[18/10/2023, 17:17:56] Zoë “cringe” Turner: No that’s fair you formed a logical conclusion. They are butterfly clips or backs - I did know that this fell on the floor I just couldn’t be bothered scrabbling around again once earring itself was found
[18/10/2023, 17:18:23] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Are you doing gratitude meetings
[18/10/2023, 18:49:23] conall: It was about 75% invitation but I don’t blame you for reading it that way. Call it 100% invitation now I’m finally done at work
[18/10/2023, 18:49:39] conall: VERY exciting times
[18/10/2023, 18:50:29] conall: Sadly no, I’m doing electric car meetings. Very dull. Ferrari? Who are they? I don’t care.

I hope your fact about tasting parathas goes down well at choir today
[18/10/2023, 19:16:10] conall: oh lastly I hope your new-housemate-but-not-yet hasn’t properly ghosted you. Very poor form if she has
[18/10/2023, 19:27:07] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Okay well, since you’re done working. I have mainly been thinking about the build up you gave me because it was stupidly hot, and also listening to you talk to me while you made me come. I think I like to be in that position I was in so much because it feels like giving myself over
[18/10/2023, 19:27:19] Zoë “cringe” Turner: But ANYWAY, you don’t wanna talk about that
[18/10/2023, 19:28:15] Zoë “cringe” Turner: never heard of Ferrari but they sound slow and unimpressive
[18/10/2023, 19:28:49] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I didn’t go to choir!! I met my friend Jess FROM choir instead and we had a drink and talked about not wanting to go to choir today
[18/10/2023, 19:29:34] Zoë “cringe” Turner: And she got back to me today but she seems pretty busy, it’s thrown me off, not sure of the vibe anymore. Should keep my flailing hands to myself probably
[18/10/2023, 20:41:19] conall: Fuck that last sentence is incredibly hot, I loved you in that position too. The way you move when you’re enjoying something is absolutely intoxicating to me, I can’t get the sounds you make out of my head.

UGH I really can’t think about anything else today. I’ve barely done any work at all AND I’m meant to be paying attention to a film currently
[18/10/2023, 20:41:35] conall: AHA. Sorry if you said that and I have forgotten. Very wholesome evening. I hope you’re feeling generally GOOD and Jess is also
[18/10/2023, 20:42:12] conall: Hmmmm annoying. Maybe don’t think too much about it (v hard to do I know). I bet she likes the hands thing, it’s very endearing. Glad she’s back in the picture in some way though
[18/10/2023, 21:13:15] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Dying to be there again not gonna lie. Hahaha I’m really not sorry. I’m enjoying it FAR too much (also what film)
[18/10/2023, 21:17:18] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I am GOOD and yeah it was good to see her as the last time I did she was at the beginning of a break up that’s taken a while, sounded not chic but she’s in a nice new flat now etc etc etc. We were actually talking about moving in with each other a while back but I missed that boat before I got the proper itch 💔
[18/10/2023, 21:18:51] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I know you find it endearing Conall but god knows what other people think. No it’s fine I’m not overthinking it!! Will just take it as it comes
[18/10/2023, 21:32:00] conall: I’m glad you are. You drive me up the wall. It’s great.

Red Dawn. The wheel selected it (it was from the vietscare wheel), it’s very average. Would much rather be doing SOMETHING else
[18/10/2023, 21:36:01] conall: Bless her, glad she’s doing well. I like things being categorised as chic/not chic, big fan of that. BIG bummer about the move though, if only dog man had sanded the floors a few weeks earlier. Did you get any good feedback about the flats you found from Ellen? (I think it was Ellen, I remember an E)
[18/10/2023, 21:36:28] conall: Everyone WILL think the same as me and think it’s great. No more thinking required. I am very sure of this.
[18/10/2023, 21:48:24] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I like that phrase because it sounds like a Britney Spears lyric but I know you mean it. 

Interesting, the 1984 version or the 2012 version? I’ve never seen either I’m just curious
[18/10/2023, 21:52:08] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Recently chic/not chic was replaced by padam/not padam due to my obsession with the song Padam Padam. Robin coined it for me personally. I didn’t use it here though because I wasn’t sure it would land 

And RIGHT? Time is a cruel mistress. No she didn’t say anything about them, I think she was mainly concerned because I asked if she’d maybe be okay lying about her cat and she said no ahahah >:(
[18/10/2023, 21:52:52] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Ok I accept it as truth
[18/10/2023, 21:56:15] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also OMG as if I forgot to mention, Han has been bitching to me about Aaron tonight
[18/10/2023, 21:57:04] Zoë “cringe” Turner: 🫠🫠🫠🫠🫠
[18/10/2023, 22:15:31] conall: It DOES. It’s a funny phrase because it sounds like you’re being annoying, which frankly today you have been. Maybe annoying is a bad word to use, you get what I mean.

1984. It’s really not holding my attention but I’ve also been organising payments for Seymour’s stag do next year. Getting 19 guys to send me £83 is proving trickier than I thought. If they don’t send it by Friday I’m going to have to pay the deposit myself and I do NOT fancy that
[18/10/2023, 22:24:23] conall: That is an absolute banger. Not quite I’m Spinning Around levels but it’s a mover. It still wouldn’t have landed though. Great call with chic / not chic.

The pet thing is quite tough tbf. I wonder why she wouldn’t want to lie? It’s not like cats are always in and you can just pretend it’s next doors or something if you get a landlord visit

Maybe the ghosting is because she thinks you’re of low moral character because you’d lie about the cat
[18/10/2023, 22:24:31] conall: WOAH
[18/10/2023, 22:25:05] conall: You’re just gonna drop that without any details? Come on Zoë I’m on the edge of my seat here
[18/10/2023, 22:30:07] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m about to sleep but feel bad leaving the cliffhanger so headlines are:

- he moans every eve about how stressful his day has been regardless of how Hannah’s day might have been
- he talks to people on the phone like suppliers and stuff like shit
- he talks to HANNAH like shit when he’s stressed ??!! 
- she is not sure she wants to wake up every day with a grumpy man

It gave me ample opportunity to very softly softly say what I think
[18/10/2023, 22:30:55] conall: Don’t worry about it
[18/10/2023, 22:31:12] conall: You’ve done enough here
[18/10/2023, 22:31:50] conall: Lots to discuss in person. Cannot wait for the full update. Unsure why I’m so invested in this relationship but I’m leaning in
[18/10/2023, 22:32:04] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I mean that is it really and this is all stuff my inner monologue knew 5 weeks ago
[18/10/2023, 22:32:32] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I love your investment thanks for coming along with me
[18/10/2023, 22:32:35] conall: your gut don’t miss
[18/10/2023, 22:32:52] conall: Hope you have a good kip
[18/10/2023, 22:33:14] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Thanks hope you do too
[18/10/2023, 22:33:43] conall: I’ve said 100 times before but thanks for coming over yesterday. Always have a great time with you. I can’t wait for this shit film to end so I can finally sleep
[18/10/2023, 22:33:58] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahahahha
[18/10/2023, 22:34:12] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Just turn it off stop having type 2 fun all the time
[18/10/2023, 22:34:53] conall: I can’t! Goob and Seymour are on the call. It would be RUDE.
[18/10/2023, 22:35:09] conall: (and yes I know my friends have stupid names)
[18/10/2023, 22:35:37] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I repeatedly have a lovely time with you too so you’re very welcome
[18/10/2023, 22:35:45] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It would be quite funny to just end the call though
[18/10/2023, 22:36:02] conall: I’ve fallen asleep on the call many times before
[18/10/2023, 22:36:13] conall: sleepy Conall can strike at any moment
[18/10/2023, 22:36:19] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m falling asleep on this call
[18/10/2023, 22:36:31] conall: valid

[19/10/2023, 13:06:56] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also if you don’t wanna do phone stuff today but you fancy a call later lemme know, I should be home by about 9.30 all being WELL
[19/10/2023, 13:38:55] conall: Hello! NOT having a great day but it’ll be fine in the end I have no doubt. Thanks for understanding, I really appreciate it. Just lots of things in the fire atm but by the end of today I’m hoping that a lot will be sorted. ALSO Thanks for your long voice note, legit didn’t want it to end. I’ll send a reply back when I’ve got this work done
[19/10/2023, 13:39:07] conall: also yes that would be absolutely delightful

[19/10/2023, 19:14:13] conall: hahahahahahahaha
[19/10/2023, 19:15:03] conall: I hadn’t thought of Aaron complex when I was saying I was being boring, but it’s possible it was a factor that I was thinking of. The way you said “than he does to be honest” was hilarious
[19/10/2023, 19:16:36] conall: Such a land of contrasts that pad thai. 5 days old but it’s getting the pistachio treatment. A bag of pistachios is actually a brilliant small gift
[19/10/2023, 19:17:15] conall: NO MORE AARON CHAT
[19/10/2023, 19:18:12] conall: I don’t know what staff crossover is, I was going to try to make a joke about angry staff but I couldn’t work it out and it wouldn’t be funny if even if I did
[19/10/2023, 19:18:36] conall: I did tell myself I’d stop doing the “i tried to think of this joke” thing but apparently I can’t
[19/10/2023, 19:18:48] conall: Enjoy your wet bum, chat to you later
[19/10/2023, 21:29:02] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m on my way homeeeee won’t be too long
[19/10/2023, 21:34:55] conall: fab, I’ll head out for a little wander

[20/10/2023, 11:10:25] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Omg
[20/10/2023, 11:10:50] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Weird because I had two thoughts either this morning or last night or in my dreams whenever
[20/10/2023, 11:11:19] Zoë “cringe” Turner: They were:
A) wow end of convo
[20/10/2023, 11:11:41] Zoë “cringe” Turner: b) wonder if there’s a market on in Chorlton
[20/10/2023, 11:11:56] Zoë “cringe” Turner: And THERES A MARKET ON
[20/10/2023, 11:12:12] Zoë “cringe” Turner: What a time to be alive
[20/10/2023, 11:12:41] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Which one is it??? Makers or something??
[20/10/2023, 11:12:55] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also
[20/10/2023, 11:13:09] Zoë “cringe” Turner: We need to send Robin £16 each
[20/10/2023, 11:13:37] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also I think you’ll like each other
[20/10/2023, 11:14:00] Zoë “cringe” Turner: At least I hope you do because I’ve just orchestrated 2+ hours of your time together
[20/10/2023, 11:14:21] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Oh and apparently she’s booked the shit seats but lol
[20/10/2023, 11:54:00] conall: THERES A MARKET ON
[20/10/2023, 11:54:04] conall: yes it’s Makers
[20/10/2023, 11:54:12] conall: fab gimme her deets
[20/10/2023, 11:55:26] conall: I’m sure we will but also we are basically doing the friend equivalent of a cinema date. How could you do this to me Zoë
[20/10/2023, 12:09:30] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Great !!!
[20/10/2023, 12:09:58] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’ll send you mine cause I’ve sorted it
[20/10/2023, 12:10:20] Zoë “cringe” Turner: No because, this will have an interval
[20/10/2023, 12:10:42] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Which to be quite honest, maybe cinema is missing as an experience
[20/10/2023, 12:11:36] Zoë “cringe” Turner: (It’s not. I remember when Vue tried to do an interval for pirates of the Caribbean 3 but the image never came back on screen for the second half)
[20/10/2023, 12:12:56] Zoë “cringe” Turner: 38637366
04-00-04
[20/10/2023, 12:25:26] conall: ofc ofc ofc. Forgot about that. Also the pre-show “hi how are we great to meet you okay let’s sit down right now shush”
[20/10/2023, 12:25:40] conall: actually the cinema has that second bit
[20/10/2023, 12:26:12] conall: I went to see that film at the odean and the same thing happened!
[20/10/2023, 12:26:20] conall: maybe the reels were dodgy or something
[20/10/2023, 12:27:01] conall: Never bothered to watch the second half, can’t imagine we missed much
[20/10/2023, 12:27:51] conall: Sent but it didn’t ask me “Is someone trying to scam you?”, maybe you have a trustworthy name
[20/10/2023, 12:53:39] Zoë “cringe” Turner: hahahah yeah everyone SHUT up
[20/10/2023, 12:53:59] Zoë “cringe” Turner: How strange, I thought this was a totally isolated experience that happened in Newcastle under Lyme
[20/10/2023, 12:55:19] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It probably would’ve asked if you’d put Zoe Plath
[20/10/2023, 12:55:41] Zoë “cringe” Turner: lucky for you the market thing is still funny
[20/10/2023, 13:43:40] conall: How gutting is it to have to spell Newcastle Under Lyme every time
[20/10/2023, 13:44:05] conall: Why did the Tyne win
[20/10/2023, 13:44:14] conall: What’ve they got that Staffs DONT
[20/10/2023, 13:44:29] conall: They’d have rejected it for being cringe I think
[20/10/2023, 13:45:19] conall: I KNEW I had one more crack at it. No more though. Let sleeping ebs/twigs/markets lie
[20/10/2023, 15:13:03] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It’s a constant source of embarrassment
[20/10/2023, 15:13:25] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahahaha you’re not wrong
[20/10/2023, 15:13:32] Zoë “cringe” Turner: HOW is your day going

[20/10/2023, 16:10:04] conall: Yeah I get what you mean. It’s a cosy night tonight, not a “I’m off to a basement to not eat kebabs” night. I very much cba going out but I’ve sacked off seeing Hannah once this week so I can’t do it again

Regardless, I can try to pump you up later but it will be in the manner of a bad personal trainer
[20/10/2023, 17:22:59] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Simultaneously the most sensical and nonsensical thing I’ve ever seen
[20/10/2023, 17:26:07] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m absolutely not going to the basement to not eat kebabs. We just had a whole police thing at work that’s tipped me over SOME EDGE. No pumping please, only solidarity with my cancellation. Not in the form of you sacking people off obviously, if I’m gonna let one Hannah down, the other one in question should be whatever the opposite of let down is
[20/10/2023, 18:33:20] conall: I'm an innovator
[20/10/2023, 18:34:33] conall: Shit what happened? No pumping will occur. I hope you're doing okay. I won't be late out tonight, we can chat on the phone later if you fancy someone to natter to about what went on
[20/10/2023, 19:50:30] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Just some kids with a knife outside the back🙄🙄 I’m fine though it just sent me into a bit of a spiral at the time. I’ll probably be flat out quite early so don’t worry I’ll fill you in tomorrow! Thank you though, have a good time at your pals x (unironic)
[20/10/2023, 21:29:27] conall: Jaysus. Very shit. Hope you’re doing okay now / get an early night / currently have frazzle hands.

Thank you! Let me know what time you fancy popping over tomorrow. I’m gonna get up early-ish and get the stuff for a FAB brunch so I’ll be about whenevs

Good night x (ironic)
[21/10/2023, 08:47:19] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hi hello
[21/10/2023, 08:49:40] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Am I involved with brunch???
[21/10/2023, 08:57:14] conall: You can be, although you can just turn up for eating if you want. It’s quite easy to make
‎[21/10/2023, 08:59:53] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ‎<attached: 00001861-AUDIO-2023-10-21-08-59-53.opus>

[21/10/2023, 09:05:06] conall: imagine me saying I’m gonna have a FAB brunch then being like “nah you’re not having it”
[21/10/2023, 09:06:10] conall: RE provisions, some toast or similar level of nosh. It won’t be huge but it will be a decent enough meal
[21/10/2023, 09:15:15] Zoë “cringe” Turner: who has maimed me in the past this way

[21/10/2023, 09:20:06] conall: 3/10 for that thumbs up
[21/10/2023, 09:20:33] conall: it’s an uncommitted thumbs up
[21/10/2023, 09:20:56] conall: if I was John from MAFSAU I would say it is not presenting a united front
[21/10/2023, 09:21:22] conall: that is tremendous
[21/10/2023, 09:21:30] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I think it’s just a sedate Saturday morning thumbs up
[21/10/2023, 09:21:44] conall: is it sedation week
[21/10/2023, 09:22:12] conall: not sure where I’m going with this but tbh
[21/10/2023, 09:22:17] conall: bit*
[21/10/2023, 09:22:25] Zoë “cringe” Turner: hahahahahha
[21/10/2023, 09:23:07] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’ve tried to carry it on twice but I’m just gonna leave it actually
[21/10/2023, 09:24:07] conall: I respect that
[21/10/2023, 10:45:17] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I can bring my bike in right? Gonna floop
[21/10/2023, 10:45:25] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Or I can just lock it nearby whatevs
[21/10/2023, 10:48:00] conall: yeah course
[21/10/2023, 10:48:25] conall: still aiming for 12ish or just before?
[21/10/2023, 10:49:03] conall: might be on the phone to my mum but she’ll be fine being dumped I’m sure
[21/10/2023, 11:10:55] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m setting off now so I’ll be about 30/40 mins I think?? no probs !
[21/10/2023, 11:21:20] conall: that’s fab, see you soon
[22/10/2023, 11:43:41] conall: sister still isn’t here 😡
[22/10/2023, 11:44:13] Zoë “cringe” Turner: what!!!!! Cringe
[22/10/2023, 11:44:25] conall: also actually cringing a LOT at what sleep Conall said
[22/10/2023, 11:44:40] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahahahaha
[22/10/2023, 11:44:42] conall: that fucking guy honestly
[22/10/2023, 11:44:46] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This is why I didn’t wanna tell you
[22/10/2023, 11:44:53] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I just think it’s funny though don’t worry
[22/10/2023, 11:44:54] conall: hahahahahahaha
[22/10/2023, 11:44:56] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It’s not that deep
[22/10/2023, 11:45:08] conall: honestly
[22/10/2023, 11:45:59] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Longford park is wild. I want to stay and find the goats but I’ll need a wee soon and then it’ll just be a whole thing
[22/10/2023, 11:46:58] conall: goats are here

https://maps.app.goo.gl/BL31qt7pKKtVJXL56?g_st=ic
[22/10/2023, 11:47:03] conall: also a toilet near the goats
[22/10/2023, 11:47:24] conall: the goats are v cute
[22/10/2023, 11:48:38] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Ok I’ll try and find
[22/10/2023, 11:48:52] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Robin has also told me to go and see the goats
[22/10/2023, 11:59:03] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Trying to find pets corner is like orienteering
[22/10/2023, 14:16:52] conall: how we getting on
[22/10/2023, 14:16:55] conall: goats no goats
[22/10/2023, 14:17:12] conall: I had forgotten about our new commitment to orient ourselves
[22/10/2023, 14:36:10] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Found:
only 1 x goat
3 x really fluffy black chickens
1 x sneezing rabbit
2 x big white ducks (1 asleep, 1 awake)
[22/10/2023, 14:36:49] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m not sure it was worth the circles I was walking myself in around that park
[22/10/2023, 14:36:54] Zoë “cringe” Turner: also right
‎[22/10/2023, 14:37:21] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ‎<attached: 00001909-PHOTO-2023-10-22-14-37-21.jpg>
[22/10/2023, 15:14:33] conall: I feel like I know where you ended up, there’s sort of two bits and if you end up in the other one you’re fucked
[22/10/2023, 15:14:47] conall: Jesus
[22/10/2023, 15:14:59] conall: Mildly horrifying that I’ve done that to you last night
[22/10/2023, 15:15:08] conall: What’s your thoughts on this state of affairs
[22/10/2023, 15:44:46] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahaha I don’t mind, quite like it to be honest
[22/10/2023, 15:45:10] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I just bruise easily and you have a firm grip
[22/10/2023, 15:59:00] conall: fantastic
[22/10/2023, 15:59:12] conall: I was gonna say, it probably won’t change anytime soon
[22/10/2023, 16:01:25] conall: Also this is a very hot pic. You’ve got amazing legs
[22/10/2023, 16:01:43] conall: Flashback city today. It just gets better and better
[22/10/2023, 16:15:17] Zoë “cringe” Turner: tell me about it, I’ve just made myself come several times again simply because I had to. I was v disappointed to leave your bed today
[22/10/2023, 17:02:27] conall: Currently sat at my parent’s place, this isn’t very fair
[22/10/2023, 17:32:58] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hehe
[22/10/2023, 18:50:14] conall: STILL not left the parents. Rager
[22/10/2023, 18:50:26] conall: How has your post-goat day gone
[22/10/2023, 19:43:38] Zoë “cringe” Turner: How’s it been???
[22/10/2023, 19:44:11] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I have NAPPED and watched big brother and called Ava and now I’m making food and that’s it
[22/10/2023, 19:56:56] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also also re seeing ya this week, are we doing Thurs? I can’t remember if we concluded. maybe we won’t go to that work thing I was on about cause possibly boring/ could do something else instead… and I am off on Friday

[22/10/2023, 21:18:30] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ps glad you’re TIRED not WIRED and I hope you sleep better tonight 🫶
[22/10/2023, 21:42:41] conall: Not a valid free chips test tbh, I also ordered chips AND onion rings. So they may have given me free chips (although I think this is unlikely). We must return to test this again
[22/10/2023, 21:43:42] conall: Tbf Big Brother does sound better than The Lamb Chop Podcast or whatever it is that we watched last time. Not sure why you put that on tbh. I think you’d do very well on Big Brother for some reason
[22/10/2023, 21:44:03] conall: also I love how much you’re enjoying people being imprisoned
[22/10/2023, 21:44:41] conall: VERY pleased about Ava even though I don’t know her. The if stage must have been absolutely AWFUL. Unsure how I’d deal with that tbh
[22/10/2023, 21:54:08] conall: and yeah the Kate thing IS a bit lame. She isn’t too happy about it but she’ll be fine I think. She asked me for advice on what to do but I don’t know what to say! So I said she should text him and ask where he’s at but maybe that’s mega cringe
[22/10/2023, 21:55:37] conall: Shall I ALSO have a think about Thursday or are you taking on this date
[22/10/2023, 22:09:02] conall: and yeah honestly I’m fine. I got it into my head that you’d be really put off from me because of it. In hindsight that was really stupid. I’m happy to chat more about it if you want to or if you have any questions at all though. I felt really good that you just listened and understood the whole thing. It sounds obvious that’s what would happen but not everyone is as understanding as you are and idk people can be odd about these things I think? I don’t know maybe my worries were completely irrational

As lame as it is, I guess I like you quite a bit (as Sleep Conall can attest, cringe) and I worried that I’d buggered this up before it got anywhere. That’s really the source of it tbh
[22/10/2023, 22:13:48] conall: I will! Thanks for saying that. I’m just getting a shower then I plan to get in bed with a warm glow of all the memories from last night, and probably do some other activity that I’m not FILTHY enough to describe here.
[22/10/2023, 22:32:25] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This was such a stupid joke and I enjoyed it a lot. Would LOVE to hear the thought process behind me doing well on Big Brother, I’m unsure. Where would I go for reset time that’s my main concern. Also update: single mum man just got evicted so I can sleep soundly tonight
[22/10/2023, 22:35:23] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I dunno it’s a bit of a yikes one to give advice for, I’d probably just say to concentrate on other people who are giving her the time of day and then if he reappears at some point that’s cool and if not his loss I suppose
[22/10/2023, 22:35:46] Zoë “cringe” Turner: We can collaborate
[22/10/2023, 22:42:05] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Okay good! I wasn’t gonna be put off by it at all but I understand the whole catastrophising thing when talking about stuff like this for the first time. I’m just glad you’re alright and that you trusted me with it. You KNOW that my feelings for Sleep Conall (and awake Conall) are reciprocated, which means it wasn’t gonna fuck anything up anyway. I guess it’s also good that you can relax about it now
[22/10/2023, 22:43:44] Zoë “cringe” Turner: But just filthy enough to allude to??? OKAY. Enjoy yourself & goodnight
[22/10/2023, 22:48:17] conall: I am very sleepy but I have just seen all these so figured I would say good night before I get into bed and do things that I have alluded to (just sleep I promise, nothing else. Certainly nothing involving thinking about you face down on my bed, moaning into a pillow). I will reply to these tomorrow.

Have a great sleep x (dramatic irony, not the other type that I can’t remember)
[22/10/2023, 22:57:08] Zoë “cringe” Turner: What a thought to fall asleep to thank you
[23/10/2023, 07:01:28] conall: Again, I will reply properly soon (I am off to the gym) but I just remembered you putting your fingers inside yourself and making me taste them. It is highly unfair that I’m expected to work today.
[23/10/2023, 08:33:16] Zoë “cringe” Turner: If I’m expected to get through MY day knowing how it feels when you fuck me and the kinds of things you tell me about myself while you’re doing it, I think you can cope with that memory.
[23/10/2023, 09:56:51] conall: Are you trying to one up me in a game of “I’m hornier than you are at work today”
[23/10/2023, 09:57:48] conall: She’s off out on a date tonight with a metal man so I’m sure she’ll be fine
[23/10/2023, 09:59:44] conall: a collaboDATE (cringe but I couldn’t resist OKAY)
[23/10/2023, 10:05:38] conall: Catastrophising is a very good word to use for this. Never heard it before, big fan. Thanks anyway, you just sat there listened and understood which is obviously the nice thing to do but I guess I didn’t expect that, even though all evidence from my interactions with you points towards you being nice and understanding.

Very stupid. Anyway I feel about 10,000 times better having talked about it. I guess all I can say is thanks a lot, I really appreciate it
[23/10/2023, 10:07:38] conall: ALSO Sleep Conall needs to be reigned in, or we need to reach some sort of armistice. I wish you talked in your sleep. I am in constant worry that I’m going to say something incredibly cringe when I sleep.

It IS funny though, which is mostly my thoughts about it currently. Anyway glad you and Sleep Conall are on the same page. He IS an idiot but he is a big fan of you.
[23/10/2023, 11:03:58] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Always
[23/10/2023, 11:05:13] Zoë “cringe” Turner: What is a ‘metal man’. A man who makes metal?? Or is he just made of steel
[23/10/2023, 11:10:06] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Ew lmao. Feel free to say no because I know I literally did just see you but let me know if you’re not doing anything later and fancy watching big brother post my inevitably life changing psychic experience - I’ll be in south anyway and Connor will be heading back to Chorlton so I just had the thought, but 0 presh. This isn’t me collabodating, merely following a dating thread
[23/10/2023, 11:13:19] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Once catastrophising is unlocked you can use it in so many contexts. I literally do it all the time, I should add it to my CV as a skill. You’re so welcome, I’m very glad you feel better 

Hahahaha. I’m trying to stop listening to him, partly for this reason, I only want to hear what you’ve consented to tell me. I do talk in my sleep sometimes but I don’t know if I tell secrets, I guess you might find out at some point

[23/10/2023, 16:13:33] conall: loved all of this note but currently out so I’ll just reply to the important bit
[23/10/2023, 16:13:40] conall: yes 9pm is fine
[23/10/2023, 16:13:52] conall: not sure about you staying over tbh
[23/10/2023, 16:14:00] conall: kinda need my space you know what I mean?
[23/10/2023, 16:14:07] conall: Feeling a bit suffocated rn
[23/10/2023, 16:14:15] conall: Hope you understand x
[23/10/2023, 16:18:20] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Conall I’m trying to be SERIOUS
[23/10/2023, 16:18:56] conall: hehe
[23/10/2023, 16:19:10] conall: regardless of my current feelings
[23/10/2023, 16:19:18] conall: 11pm Conall wants you to stay
[23/10/2023, 16:19:30] conall: and I don’t like getting in that guys way
[23/10/2023, 16:19:39] conall: this makes it sound like I don’t currently want you to stay
[23/10/2023, 16:19:47] conall: I do want you to stay as it happens
[23/10/2023, 16:20:06] conall: bring your pjs etc etc, unsure what people say in these situations
[23/10/2023, 16:26:06] Zoë “cringe” Turner: that was unnecessarily stressful
[23/10/2023, 16:26:24] Zoë “cringe” Turner: But fine if you’re that desperate for me to stay I guess I will
[23/10/2023, 16:26:31] Zoë “cringe” Turner: xx
[23/10/2023, 17:08:50] conall: I wouldn’t call it desperation
[23/10/2023, 17:09:04] conall: A mild yearn
[23/10/2023, 17:09:14] conall: Nothing wrong with a yearn on a Monday evening
[23/10/2023, 20:21:02] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Right I’ve had my cards read
[23/10/2023, 20:21:09] Zoë “cringe” Turner: We’re on our way to the tram
[23/10/2023, 20:25:09] conall: quality
[23/10/2023, 20:25:21] conall: do i have time for a shower? evening has passed me by
[23/10/2023, 20:28:02] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yeah think so
[23/10/2023, 20:50:02] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Are you out of it now
[23/10/2023, 20:55:06] conall: yeah have been for yonks
[23/10/2023, 20:55:18] conall: were you waiting for a go ahead text from me
[23/10/2023, 20:56:09] Zoë “cringe” Turner: No Hahahha
[23/10/2023, 20:56:21] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Imagine
[23/10/2023, 20:56:39] conall: I was gonna say

[24/10/2023, 10:05:32] conall: kinda stuff that this fantastic shop traffics in
[24/10/2023, 10:05:40] conall: also cucumbers (which I did need)
‎[24/10/2023, 10:13:36] conall: ‎<attached: 00001993-PHOTO-2023-10-24-10-13-36.jpg>
[24/10/2023, 10:13:46] conall: excessive savings
[24/10/2023, 10:22:12] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Get me one please
[24/10/2023, 10:22:35] Zoë “cringe” Turner: WAIT this is Friday
[24/10/2023, 10:22:53] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Did you say Friday earlier
[24/10/2023, 10:25:51] conall: oops
[24/10/2023, 10:26:20] conall: I’ll book Thursday now
[24/10/2023, 10:32:19] Zoë “cringe” Turner: That is so many savings
[24/10/2023, 10:32:26] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m quite confused by Factory’s business model
[24/10/2023, 10:32:59] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Are you gonna go twice lol
[24/10/2023, 10:33:02] conall: right booked for Thursday
[24/10/2023, 10:33:12] conall: nah I’ve just offered the tickets to Handy
[24/10/2023, 10:33:29] conall: if he doesn’t take them I’ll go round the roster
[24/10/2023, 10:33:37] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Sounds good
[24/10/2023, 10:33:41] conall: it really is
[24/10/2023, 10:33:42] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It’s meant to be very good
[24/10/2023, 10:33:53] Zoë “cringe” Turner: How much do I need to send you £3?
[24/10/2023, 10:34:03] conall: you know what
[24/10/2023, 10:34:09] conall: call this a gift
[24/10/2023, 10:34:16] conall: goodness of my own heart and all that
[24/10/2023, 10:34:24] Zoë “cringe” Turner: No
[24/10/2023, 10:34:29] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I can’t possibly accept
[24/10/2023, 10:34:34] Zoë “cringe” Turner: That’s too generous
[24/10/2023, 10:34:42] conall: look look
[24/10/2023, 10:34:48] conall: you brought round the borders
[24/10/2023, 10:35:04] conall: I HAVE to return the favour
[24/10/2023, 10:35:07] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Oh that’s true
[24/10/2023, 10:35:11] Zoë “cringe” Turner: They were probably £6
[24/10/2023, 10:35:16] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I wasn’t looking
[24/10/2023, 10:35:49] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Do you know what I was actually trying to find those German gingerbread things cause I wanted to show you how amazing they are
[24/10/2023, 10:36:00] Zoë “cringe” Turner: But couldn’t find them
[24/10/2023, 10:36:14] conall: that is very sweet
[24/10/2023, 10:36:26] conall: I do want to give them a try but I’ll resist until you are there
[24/10/2023, 10:36:36] conall: don’t wanna spoil the moment
[24/10/2023, 10:36:47] Zoë “cringe” Turner: :)
[24/10/2023, 10:39:04] conall: Sorry if I was a bit off when you left, I couldn’t be arsed explaining but work is looking like it’s gonna be LAME
[24/10/2023, 10:39:29] conall: maybe I’ll just take your job when you leave the whitworth
[24/10/2023, 10:39:58] conall: Anyway I hope the Ryan business gets sorted out and you have the support club you all deserve
[24/10/2023, 10:40:03] conall: supper*
[24/10/2023, 10:42:53] Zoë “cringe” Turner: No it’s fine I knew that’s what it was! Im sorry I hope it goes quickly
[24/10/2023, 10:43:59] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Omg just remembered you telling me you wanted to come into work and sneak me into the toilets UGH
[24/10/2023, 10:44:17] Zoë “cringe” Turner: just think about how nice last night was when work is rubbish today
[24/10/2023, 10:44:30] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I think it’ll be fine hahaha sorry for stressing
[24/10/2023, 10:44:39] Zoë “cringe” Turner: We just have a strange dynamic sometimes
[24/10/2023, 11:01:17] conall: the offer still stands
[24/10/2023, 11:01:43] conall: It was VERY nice. It was like a free date. Didn’t even expect it to happen. Total result
[24/10/2023, 11:02:40] conall: I think that’s common with people you’re mega mega good friends with, it’s like family dynamics in a weird way. No need to apologise about stressing you’re all good honestly
[24/10/2023, 11:22:17] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Genuinely don’t think I’d get away with it at work because I’m so visible at all times but take me somewhere else and I’d be down
[24/10/2023, 11:22:36] Zoë “cringe” Turner: SURPRISE you won a date
[24/10/2023, 11:22:47] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’ve stopped counting the dates so don’t know what number you won on
[24/10/2023, 11:23:11] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This is true, he’s like another dysfunctional brother sometimes
[24/10/2023, 11:23:53] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Two things:
My pyjamas smell like mushrooms, yes I have put them back on I have about an hour to sleep more

I checked my weight to see if the psychic was right and she fucking was
[24/10/2023, 11:56:30] conall: You still need to take me to all the art galleries in Manchester anyway. Holding out on me over there
[24/10/2023, 11:57:03] conall: which reminds me I’m going to one (I forget which) on Saturday with Dan and Iona. You’re working aren’t you?
[24/10/2023, 11:58:29] conall: I was just thinking this (but not vocalising it) last night. Couldn’t remember what number we’re on. There’s something funny to me about tracking them by number but I feel like I’ve missed that boat. I might try and work it out later on
[24/10/2023, 11:59:19] conall: better than yellow

OF COURSE she was. I am totally in on this psychic after she said the leo thing. She’s like Nostradamus.m
[24/10/2023, 13:16:51] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Is it city art gallery? If you’re going to that one we can do the Chinese contemporary arts one. And then you’ve done them all. Except mine Obv, unless you’re going there on Saturday and you’re trying to trick me. Yeah I am working the weekend
[24/10/2023, 13:17:01] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahaha I knew you would be for some reason
[24/10/2023, 13:21:20] Zoë “cringe” Turner: She ALSO said she saw someone tall and funny, which is what I want (according to her). I held back on telling you this though because cringe/not real anyway. And you’re not that tall
[24/10/2023, 14:12:55] conall: honestly
[24/10/2023, 14:13:23] conall: maybe she got confused because I’m SO funny
[24/10/2023, 14:13:52] conall: she thought she’d give you some latitude because obv how you gonna find the funniest man alive (which is what she’d have to say otherwise)
[24/10/2023, 14:34:18] conall: it’s the one that the Couture thing is at, I thinks it’s just called “Manchester Art Gallery” but I might be mistaken. Let’s do the chinese one though, I’ve heard it’s great.

Also yes I did know that. BUMMER. I was gonna invite you
[24/10/2023, 14:34:53] conall: Hahahahaha, RIGHT I’m gonna work it out
[24/10/2023, 14:35:04] conall: actually trying to work out a career move today, fuckin sick of this
[24/10/2023, 14:42:26] conall: right I’ve got to levvie now I’m lost
[24/10/2023, 14:42:39] conall: ffs wish I used my calendars
[24/10/2023, 14:52:37] conall: ‎You deleted this message.
[24/10/2023, 14:53:07] conall: okay I’m unsure of the dates of the dates and it’s possible I missed one BUT I think that’s the lot
[24/10/2023, 16:09:00] Zoë “cringe” Turner: WHY have you deleted this table? It made me laugh once and I wanted to laugh at it again
[24/10/2023, 16:09:24] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Specifically the part about me being on a plinth
[24/10/2023, 16:09:55] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also wanted to cross check !!!!
[24/10/2023, 16:10:02] Zoë “cringe” Turner: 😠
[24/10/2023, 16:12:42] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Okay well this is kind of exciting I suppose. I’m afraid I don’t have anybody in programming I can text BUT we could connect on LinkedIn as I hear it would be mutually beneficial
[24/10/2023, 16:14:14] Zoë “cringe” Turner: But yeah it sounds like you could do with something that places less solely on your head, and might be a nice opportunity to ‘embed’ in town a bit
[24/10/2023, 16:25:28] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’ve got like cross gallery goss about MAG (that is the one you’re going to, work abbreviation). We are WAG. We’re like a partnership but also not, it’s weird vibes over there staff wise. BUT a lovely gallery, you will like it. Yes let’s do the Chinese one I haven’t been in ages
‎[24/10/2023, 16:27:51] conall: ‎<attached: 00002069-PHOTO-2023-10-24-16-27-51.jpg>
[24/10/2023, 16:28:43] conall: can’t remember why I deleted it. Stressful day probably just me being an idiot in some form. I think it’s all there. You can help me with the third as yet included column, the actual dates
[24/10/2023, 16:29:55] conall: actually it’s only really 2 and 5 that I can’t work out dates for. Not that important anyway but fun in its own way
[24/10/2023, 16:30:20] conall: I’ll reply to other stuff in a bit I just wanted to make sure you could get your cross referencing done
[24/10/2023, 17:03:53] conall: Yeah this is part of it and tbh I just sort of hate programming now. The work I do atm I love but I’ve just no spark for it anymore.

I HAVE come up with a better plan though. Work in this job until I have a deposit for a house, be a proper squirrel about how I save. I’ve got a whole spreadsheet and everything now. It’s all very serious. THEN once the house is sorted, I can probably afford to leave this line of work and get a job I actually like. Something to do with conservation and trees would be amazing but I’m just rambling now
[24/10/2023, 17:10:08] conall: Hope you’re having a fun time at work and the annoying gallery exhibition isn’t too faffy. I AM looking forward to seeing you on Thursday though. Let me know what your thoughts are for after it. We can head back to mine (or yours) but I’m also easy if you just wanna head home and chill on your todd

Also very annoying you’ve pied my offer of fucking you in the toilets, but at least you’ll have that mental image to keep you occupied if you’re taking a break this evening. Just thought I’d remind you of it in case you’d forgotten
[24/10/2023, 19:18:03] Zoë “cringe” Turner: 2 was the 18th Sept, mad that we did no. 2 so close to no. 1, very unusual proceedings for myself

THREADS was 9th October. Another quick turnaround from the 6th but more normal behaviour for Date 5 maybe ???? Anyway this is silly let’s cease and desist
[24/10/2023, 19:24:12] Zoë “cringe” Turner: LOVE this plan. Love a money spreadsheet, would love to see it. I think you’re in a good position for sure, and it’s super nice that you can think about changing lanes later on. ESPECIALLY if it’s to save the trees and the human race xxxxx slay
[24/10/2023, 19:26:39] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Just remembered my psychic told me I’d make a good teacher. Sorry these are just going to come back to me when prompted by conversation matter. I could never be a teacher I would cry every day
[24/10/2023, 19:39:31] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I am DONE at work like 2 hours early. Basically just sent a long email about all my security concerns and then helped pick some watermelon off the floor. I hope pottery is good and you can do some decompressing there !! 

Very much looking forward to seeing you too, and to seeing what the fuss is about this performance with all the rabbits. I’ll finish work at 5 so I’ll be in town if you wanna meet before. Would love to come back with u if that’s cool
[24/10/2023, 19:41:14] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I hadn’t forgotten, but thank you for yet again meeting my ongoing mental images from across The Phone

[24/10/2023, 20:25:33] conall: love being sat at the front of the bus
[24/10/2023, 20:25:44] conall: cool kid mode
[24/10/2023, 20:26:43] conall: I have things to say about this but we have ceased. Into the ether they go
[24/10/2023, 20:29:19] conall: It’s quite basic, just income and outcome, then some “food / fun / misc” spending then a remainder of what I’ve got left. I’ve also realised that this long standing debt I have will be paid off very soon so maybe I’ll just hurry that up then I can get on house mode. Aiming to save £20k which is a fuckin LOT as it turns out. Having goals is good though, it’s very type A of me

Thanks for the slay comment, I’m unsure what it means in this context but I understand it’s generally positive
[24/10/2023, 20:30:48] conall: I think you would make a good teacher because you’re very good with people, but who would want to be a teacher anyway. Looks like such a rough gig. Stick with the writing because you ARE good with words
[24/10/2023, 20:32:36] conall: Absolutely tremendous. How was the gallery thing tonight? It sounded annoying, I hope it wasn’t.

Yes deffo game to meet you earlier, I’ll need some grub anyway. I’ll have a think when I’m less blurry about where we should go. UNLESS you want to collabodate on options
[24/10/2023, 20:32:48] conall: Get out of my head!
[24/10/2023, 21:00:59] Zoë “cringe” Turner: You’re such a keeno
[24/10/2023, 21:05:09] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also your stella / fritaya bath sounds disgustingly good. It’s like you’re a fallen woman in a period drama. HAVE FUN. I’m confused as to why you and Kate go home separately after pottery, is it because she has to pack up etc ???? and you’re like I’m a paying customer I’m outta here
[24/10/2023, 21:10:25] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I also hate talking on the phone on the bus. Don’t worry about it. Also you’ll never guess what I’m busy with Conall, you just won’t guess it’s so left field so I’ll just tell you
[24/10/2023, 21:11:41] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It’s MAFs. Can you BELIEVE 🤪 I think my brain is maybe melting a bit
[24/10/2023, 21:11:57] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Oh say them

[24/10/2023, 21:30:23] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Oh do you know what we should do
[24/10/2023, 21:30:39] Zoë “cringe” Turner: We should just go to the chippy next door to Cask and take our chips into Cask because you can do that there
[24/10/2023, 21:32:40] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It’s a good chippy n all
[24/10/2023, 22:21:21] conall: wow you’re very tired
[24/10/2023, 22:21:37] conall: I’m really enjoying tired Zoë (wrote it like that because I fancy you)
[24/10/2023, 22:25:53] conall: Aw that last bit is very cute, thanks. I was just thinking that this morning about how ANNOYING it is that I have to wait till Thursday but then actually how that’s a good thing because I like the excitement of it all. I could say more but I’ll let sleep Conall handle that.

Also I find it hilarious how you were basically talking to a different guy when we first got chatting, at least that’s how you perceived it. Very funny
[24/10/2023, 22:26:09] conall: I have a suggestion to break the stalemate btw
[24/10/2023, 22:26:16] conall: I might have suggested this before maybe
[24/10/2023, 22:28:49] conall: basically it’s a film night AND a good night, which isn’t revelatory. BUT I think it’d be fun to pick a country, then make some food from that country, then watch a film from that country also
[24/10/2023, 22:29:13] conall: not that I don’t enjoy some lobotomy television (I am a big fan I hope that’s clear)
[24/10/2023, 22:29:34] conall: top shout. Never done this or heard of it even but yes very happy for this suggestion
[24/10/2023, 22:30:13] conall: It was more just questions really. We can save it for another time
[24/10/2023, 22:33:24] conall: also yes just watched it with Kate, very very heavy. Many thoughts. We can discuss post-matrix.

It’s so hard to categorise! But I do need to do what you’ve done (cut back). I just need to deny myself the money I have and somehow just get it out of me. I used to be great at budgeting when I didn’t have much money, I think earning a bit more you just think “oh fuck it it’ll be fine” but then you just stay where you are. I want a house damnit! Old Trafford has nice ones for like £300k which is a LOT but doable if I get the budgeting down for a good period of time
[24/10/2023, 22:33:58] conall: Listened to this last bit a few times now. Loving that. Yes it’s cringe obviously (it’s not)
‎[25/10/2023, 07:39:23] conall: ‎<attached: 00002111-PHOTO-2023-10-25-07-39-23.jpg>
[25/10/2023, 07:40:10] conall: not sure if I told you, but I actually go climbing. I’m a very cool guy. Chalk everywhere. I would invite you but you’d climb weird.
[25/10/2023, 08:38:34] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Do you ever climb right to the top and just sit there with your legs dangling over like you’ve won climbing? That’s what I would do cause I’d be so good
[25/10/2023, 09:17:37] conall: annoyingly enough they don’t allow you to do that
[25/10/2023, 09:18:42] conall: Padam was on this morning you’ll be pleased to know. Fantastic tune to have stuck in my head. I won’t refer to things as Padam / Not Padam because that’s not a joke I’m involved with and that would be weird
[25/10/2023, 09:40:30] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Sorry I AM going to reply properly I’m just in rush around mode
[25/10/2023, 09:40:56] Zoë “cringe” Turner: You can use Padam/Not Padam the joke is anybody’s and frankly should be everybody’s

[25/10/2023, 15:41:51] conall: This is ace! You know me well. I DO like this a lot. 0:12 is my favourite. Big fan of that guy. Hope you and your Dad are having a lovely day
[25/10/2023, 17:12:25] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It’s so good right!
[25/10/2023, 17:13:56] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I am home now, just spoken to Ellen too. Up for a call if you’re free whenever, I was supposed to be somewhere tonight but am completely exhausted again for whatever reason
[25/10/2023, 17:33:11] conall: Oh ace, I’m just getting some stuff finished at work then I can bell you if you want. I’ll be about 15/20 if that works?
[25/10/2023, 17:35:53] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I might just get my tea sorted first if that’s alright, boyfriend will be back taking over the kitchen with his chefers past imminently
[25/10/2023, 17:37:37] conall: Yeah don’t worry about it, I’ve got a lot of dhal to be noshing anyway. Give us a bell when you fancy it
[25/10/2023, 19:20:47] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Gosh sorry it’s been 2 hours and a film has been put on. I know you said you’re … spinning something?
[25/10/2023, 19:35:56] conall: it’s all good, I’ve just been eating dhal then chatted with my Dad for a bit. I’m not wheeling (watching a film, unsure if I explained this vocab), we all sacked it off individually. Love it when things work out like that. I’m just gonna read tonight then probably watch some MAFS with Kate when she’s back from teaching at about 9:30
[25/10/2023, 19:38:14] conall: ALSO don’t feel obliged to call just cos you said you’re up for it before. You might not but just saying in case you do. Hope you’re feeling a bit less overwhelmed and you get some 24-carat relaxation in tonight
[25/10/2023, 19:53:07] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I did have a niggling thought it might have been the film wheel but I also was like: POTTERY? Idk why
[25/10/2023, 19:53:52] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m not obliged!! Can I call you in like 45 minutes? I will let you go before MAFs don’t worry
[25/10/2023, 20:04:11] conall: You’ve had a big pottery day tbf. Clay on the brain
[25/10/2023, 20:04:20] conall: Sounds utterly fantastic

[26/10/2023, 07:18:53] Zoë “cringe” Turner: 🥹🥹🥹
[26/10/2023, 07:21:36] conall: it’ll be a while before I don’t physically cringe at that
[26/10/2023, 07:53:18] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Should I have hidden it better?
[26/10/2023, 08:22:39] conall: oh I meant I’m physically cringing at me doing this
[26/10/2023, 08:22:43] conall: not this
[26/10/2023, 08:27:30] Zoë “cringe” Turner: no I actually meant
[26/10/2023, 08:27:49] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Would you rather I had kept the secret properly and not in a baity ‘I have a secret’ way
[26/10/2023, 08:30:56] conall: hahahahahah I see
[26/10/2023, 08:31:12] conall: Nah I guess it’s nice to know what Sleep Conall is up to
[26/10/2023, 08:31:43] conall: Also the fact you’ve told me means that it went down well with you, so yea it’s cringe but it’s also fine
[26/10/2023, 08:32:37] conall: or not well, but at least not terribly. You’d have probably not said anything in that case
[26/10/2023, 08:41:33] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yeah I just think it’s cute
[26/10/2023, 08:41:55] Zoë “cringe” Turner: But you’re lucky it was me he was saying it to. Anyone else would probs think it was well weird
[26/10/2023, 09:08:40] conall: I might just lean into it
[26/10/2023, 09:08:45] conall: become an adoration guy
[26/10/2023, 09:09:05] conall: “WOW I adore that” etc etc
[26/10/2023, 09:09:22] conall: then me saying it to you is just me being me
[26/10/2023, 10:06:01] Zoë “cringe” Turner: hahahahahha
[26/10/2023, 10:06:07] Zoë “cringe” Turner: GENIUS
[26/10/2023, 12:42:14] conall: very boring question for Zoë

do you have the ability to print things at work

very fun question for Zoë to balance things out

what’s your favourite vegetable
[26/10/2023, 13:04:04] Zoë “cringe” Turner: YES
[26/10/2023, 13:04:06] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I do
[26/10/2023, 13:04:09] Zoë “cringe” Turner: What do you need
[26/10/2023, 13:04:24] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Not answering your vegetable question because it seems shoehorned
[26/10/2023, 13:16:08] conall: one of these days I’ll find this out
[26/10/2023, 13:16:26] conall: if I have to get Sleep Zoë involved I will
[26/10/2023, 13:16:40] conall: i have a label that needs printing, let me grab it
[26/10/2023, 13:17:07] conall: actually what’s your email address
[26/10/2023, 13:17:11] conall: that’s probably easier isn’t it
[26/10/2023, 13:17:48] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahahhaha she doesn’t exist !!!!
[26/10/2023, 13:19:50] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Send it to zoe.smithturner@manchester.ac.uk 🤛
[26/10/2023, 13:25:46] conall: fuming
[26/10/2023, 13:39:44] conall: the asymmetry in our sleep personas need to be rectified
[26/10/2023, 13:39:56] conall: Amazing has sent you an email
[26/10/2023, 13:55:18] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I will not be exposed
[26/10/2023, 13:56:03] conall: hacks me off
[26/10/2023, 13:56:16] conall: you get to say stuff like “oh there’s loads I WOULD say but I won’t”
[26/10/2023, 13:56:30] conall: then you trot off all chuffed with yourself
[26/10/2023, 13:56:53] Zoë “cringe” Turner: hehehe
[26/10/2023, 13:57:04] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Be careful or I won’t print your silly label
[26/10/2023, 13:58:18] conall: 😡
[26/10/2023, 17:04:15] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hi just leaving work!
[26/10/2023, 17:04:27] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Are you on track? Might get a bus half way
[26/10/2023, 17:06:47] conall: very on track
[26/10/2023, 17:06:52] conall: just waiting at the tram stop
[26/10/2023, 17:08:17] conall: also
[26/10/2023, 17:08:29] conall: I got a mac from a charity shop cos I thought why not and it was £7
[26/10/2023, 17:08:46] conall: I am currently wearing it on a “do i like this” mish
[26/10/2023, 17:08:58] conall: my main worry, however
[26/10/2023, 17:09:10] conall: is that it looks like I’m wearing a matrix coat for the occasion
[26/10/2023, 17:09:24] conall: it is navy though so I think i’ll be fine
[26/10/2023, 17:11:11] Zoë “cringe” Turner: hahahaha
[26/10/2023, 17:11:16] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Mega fan over here
[26/10/2023, 17:11:37] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Should’ve bought my sunnies to help you complete the look
[26/10/2023, 17:11:40] conall: cringe or what
[26/10/2023, 17:11:58] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Mega cringe didn’t realise we were going to Matrixcon
[26/10/2023, 17:12:18] conall: it’ll be worrying me all night this
[26/10/2023, 17:12:22] conall: like a splinter in my mind
[26/10/2023, 17:12:24] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Anyway I should be at the meeting place by 5.30 or shortly after
[26/10/2023, 17:12:47] conall: possibly the lamest joke I’ve ever made and if you get the ick I wouldn’t even blame you
[26/10/2023, 17:12:54] conall: fantastic
[26/10/2023, 17:12:57] conall: I will also be there
[26/10/2023, 17:14:13] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Was it a matrix joke
[26/10/2023, 17:14:23] conall: …
[26/10/2023, 17:14:24] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Because my main worry tonight is that I’ve not actually seen the matrix
[26/10/2023, 17:14:30] conall: love that
[26/10/2023, 17:14:36] conall: this is fantastic
[26/10/2023, 17:14:39] Zoë “cringe” Turner: That’s good
[26/10/2023, 17:14:52] conall: this is gonna be your first encounter with the matrix
[26/10/2023, 17:14:54] conall: hilarious
[26/10/2023, 17:14:59] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yeah stupid isn’t it
[26/10/2023, 17:15:02] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Not sure why I agreed
[26/10/2023, 17:15:04] conall: great bit
[26/10/2023, 17:15:08] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Shall we watch the matrix after
[26/10/2023, 17:15:10] conall: I assumed you’d seen it
[26/10/2023, 17:15:15] conall: you seemed down
[26/10/2023, 17:15:31] conall: not watched it in absolutely yonks so yes

[26/10/2023, 17:15:45] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I just haven’t seen the matrix
[26/10/2023, 17:16:17] conall: this is true
[26/10/2023, 17:16:21] conall: not mutually exclusive
[26/10/2023, 17:16:29] conall: I thought down = seen matrix
[26/10/2023, 17:16:33] conall: how foolish of me to assume
[26/10/2023, 17:16:34] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Exactly
[26/10/2023, 17:16:39] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Incorrect assumption
[26/10/2023, 17:16:46] conall: mind being blown here

[26/10/2023, 17:17:49] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m not sure if it does
[26/10/2023, 17:17:53] Zoë “cringe” Turner: We’ll cross check

[27/10/2023, 13:52:39] conall: i liked how imposing the walls on the either side of me were
[27/10/2023, 13:53:11] Zoë “cringe” Turner: The Tesco stock trolleys too
[27/10/2023, 13:53:14] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Ominous
[27/10/2023, 13:53:25] conall: I hadn’t noticed them tbh
[27/10/2023, 13:53:29] conall: I was mostly looking up
[27/10/2023, 13:53:35] conall: I like to be awed
[27/10/2023, 13:53:47] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I was staring at them for quite a while waiting for the bus to leave
[27/10/2023, 13:53:52] conall: Tesco stock trolleys ain’t awing anyone
[27/10/2023, 13:54:03] conall: how did I look when I was walking away
[27/10/2023, 13:54:08] conall: enigmatic, I assume
[27/10/2023, 13:54:43] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I didn’t see you, that’s when I was busy queuing, but I assume you probably looked like someone on the Danny Boyle matrix catwalk
[27/10/2023, 13:55:01] Zoë “cringe” Turner: So yes enigmatic if you like
[27/10/2023, 13:55:12] conall: I do like, thank you very much

[27/10/2023, 13:55:55] conall: I DO think it’ll be good, I probably wasn’t clear about that
[27/10/2023, 13:56:25] conall: she is very nice (as evidenced by how she has been with me), I hope I didn’t give the impression that she’s a nightmare or something
[27/10/2023, 13:56:39] conall: and yes obv a bit weird but also silly and quite funny

[27/10/2023, 15:04:46] conall: actually
[27/10/2023, 15:04:50] conall: you’re not seeing that
[27/10/2023, 15:05:12] conall: i said this

I was a bit like “oh god is this gonna be weird” initially but I don’t think it would be. HOWEVER if you did it wouldn’t be a problem at all I have no doubt, don’t feel pressured or owt
[27/10/2023, 15:14:46] Zoë “cringe” Turner: UGH! Wanted to see your dad emoji text
[27/10/2023, 15:15:20] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Okay well she’s said it’s completely fine
[27/10/2023, 15:15:25] Zoë “cringe” Turner: So it’s all fine
[27/10/2023, 15:15:39] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Everything’s out in the open
[27/10/2023, 15:16:04] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Like someone’s had a dramatic affair and now we can all move on
[27/10/2023, 15:16:40] conall: no because I said something very nice (cringe) about you
[27/10/2023, 15:16:57] conall: hilarious
[27/10/2023, 15:17:15] Zoë “cringe” Turner: OH
[27/10/2023, 15:17:15] conall: can’t wait
[27/10/2023, 15:17:21] conall: cannot wait for this to happen
[27/10/2023, 15:17:27] conall: love this whole situation
[27/10/2023, 15:17:34] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I literally think it’ll work out as well
[27/10/2023, 15:17:38] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahahahahahahah
[27/10/2023, 15:17:56] Zoë “cringe” Turner: But now I’m worried about the other two and this house thing
[27/10/2023, 15:18:56] conall: how do?
[27/10/2023, 15:18:59] conall: how so*
[27/10/2023, 15:19:01] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Cause they’ve essentially found somewhere and if I drop out they lose it? But that’s not really my problem is it
[27/10/2023, 15:19:21] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Like because they don’t have another third person anymore
[27/10/2023, 15:19:27] Zoë “cringe” Turner: But
[27/10/2023, 15:19:31] Zoë “cringe” Turner: That viewing is Monday
[27/10/2023, 15:19:40] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Idk
[27/10/2023, 15:19:43] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m going to sleep
[27/10/2023, 15:19:46] conall: you don’t need to make any decisions
[27/10/2023, 15:19:51] conall: just get the vibe from both
[27/10/2023, 15:20:19] conall: KK
[27/10/2023, 15:20:27] conall: I’d have thought you’d already gone
[27/10/2023, 16:52:08] conall: incoming standard effusive text about the last time I saw you a few hours ago

THANKS for a great night and a fantastic day today. Spending time with you is just ace. Also I will not be able to get over what you did to me yesterday for some time. Cannot get it out of my head.
[27/10/2023, 16:56:30] conall: Also this reads like you stabbed me / broke my heart in some way
[27/10/2023, 17:05:32] conall: lastly my bed smells like you which is fantastic

okay i’ll stop with the effusive texts now. Back to Aloof Conall

[27/10/2023, 17:36:36] conall: That’s a really lovely message (besides the last 10 seconds of utter filth. Side note: stop making me hard when you’re not even near me please?).

Honestly to be told I make you feel happy and safe is pretty much the best thing you could ever say to me. Without sounding like an total SOP I’m glad that I give you what you need when you’ve got so much other shit going on in your life atm. I’m a bit drunk currently so l’ll end up saying something stupid if I carry on BUT I’ll just say not a day goes by I am not absolutely made up about this whole thing
[27/10/2023, 17:57:52] Zoë “cringe” Turner: As if you’re drunk ALREADY love that you were all like ‘I just wanna go to the gig’ but Greg has absolutely won this BNO situation. Hope you have a great time. 

And yeah WELL I just think that aura thing you were talking about definitely exists around this whatever it is. Like you know you were talking about feeling me kinda just droop when you say things to me that I wanna hear in bed? You should also know that I’m doing some version of that constantly just talking to you/being around ya. It happens a lot. Anyway I’m done now, THAT’S THE TWEET. I don’t know if you’ll get that reference but risking it anyway. Sorry not sorry that you’re hard at inconvenient moments thinking about me.
[27/10/2023, 19:01:46] conall: He really has. GBNO is in full effect. I hope YOU have a great time also

I’ve had 3 tequila sunscreens since my last message. Not in a state to reply to all this but I DO wanna say that it is my favourite text ever. Thanks for saying it. I also think the same
[27/10/2023, 19:01:54] conall: don’t get the ref but that’s fine
[27/10/2023, 19:01:59] conall: also, stop it
[27/10/2023, 19:45:32] Zoë “cringe” Turner: SUNCREENS? Adore it
[27/10/2023, 20:12:41] conall: Could you be arsed adoring things. Effort init
[27/10/2023, 20:25:32] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Nah I couldn’t but then you started rubbing off
[27/10/2023, 20:33:31] conall: I’m over it
[27/10/2023, 20:33:41] conall: I’m DONE adoring stuff
[27/10/2023, 20:33:46] conall: I get nothing back for it
[28/10/2023, 08:36:22] Zoë “cringe” Turner: How was it ???? Hope you adored it I don’t want anyone to take adoration away from you
[28/10/2023, 08:36:37] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I fell asleep on the sofa and never left
[28/10/2023, 08:36:40] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahaha
[28/10/2023, 08:36:58] Zoë “cringe” Turner: All the more energy to dress up as a person in a CAPE tonight

[28/10/2023, 14:25:02] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Oh dear you don’t sound very 💯
[28/10/2023, 14:27:53] conall: 💯, not I

not I
[28/10/2023, 14:28:41] conall: how much pep do you have in your step after your BNOC
[28/10/2023, 16:13:56] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Tbh I also have very little pep, think my sinuses are fucking me over AGAIN
[28/10/2023, 16:14:04] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Boring boring
[28/10/2023, 18:06:41] conall: Aaron complex
[28/10/2023, 18:06:49] conall: what’s the pep status
[28/10/2023, 18:07:03] conall: you pepped enough for the partay
[28/10/2023, 18:17:47] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yeah massive
[28/10/2023, 18:17:50] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I DONT KNOW
[28/10/2023, 18:18:02] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I can’t decide and I’m in turmoil about it
[28/10/2023, 18:18:31] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Adam also not vibing but going anyway so maybe I go and pair with him in that respect
[28/10/2023, 18:18:53] Zoë “cringe” Turner: But my head does currently feel like it’s not on my shoulders
[28/10/2023, 18:19:15] Zoë “cringe” Turner: What are you doing
[28/10/2023, 18:19:18] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Are you dead or alive
[28/10/2023, 18:28:42] conall: pep turmoil does NOT sound fun
[28/10/2023, 18:29:00] conall: Interested to hear more about this
[28/10/2023, 18:29:50] conall: Currently in town having a few bevs, gonna head back via big asda to get some spare bedding (very fun). Then go to this party for a bit but I ALSO can’t be arsed
[28/10/2023, 18:31:01] conall: If you do fancy popping round later let me know, I’ll likely have a few bevs then get into my comfy new bedding. No presh though
[28/10/2023, 18:40:07] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I have decided I have neither the corporeal mileage or the money for Ubers to go anywhere
[28/10/2023, 18:40:22] Zoë “cringe” Turner: So I’m at least out of turmoil
[28/10/2023, 18:41:09] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Even though this sounds way easier than trying to have a nice time at the party
[28/10/2023, 18:41:49] Zoë “cringe” Turner: You do need some spare bedding to be fair, good Saturday night mission to put upon yourself
[28/10/2023, 18:45:20] conall: BUMMER
[28/10/2023, 18:45:37] conall: I will make one offer but feel free to pie me off
[28/10/2023, 18:45:44] conall: I am due a pieing anyway
[28/10/2023, 18:47:06] conall: Matrix at mine this eve. I would LOVE an excuse to fuck this party off, Kate’s out all eve and it would be nice to see you.

HOWEVER I will not be offended in the slightlest if you cba
[28/10/2023, 18:50:35] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Would ‘sorry guys I’m watching the Matrix’ really wash?
[28/10/2023, 18:50:58] conall: I’ve already put out the vibe that I’m not feeling it tbh
[28/10/2023, 18:51:08] conall: The Matrix doesn’t need to be mentioned
[28/10/2023, 18:51:34] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahaha
[28/10/2023, 18:53:47] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m very glad you asked because on most other occasions it’d be a yes but honestly I’m so tired and once I was there I wouldn’t wanna leave but I have work again tomorrow and it would just be another turmoil recipe
[28/10/2023, 18:55:02] conall: Yeah tbh after I asked I thought all of these things
[28/10/2023, 18:55:44] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I know this is a sinus attack cause all I wanna do is sleep and I’ve also realised I have no real day off now until next Saturday
[28/10/2023, 18:56:07] Zoë “cringe” Turner: So must conserve
[28/10/2023, 18:56:13] Zoë “cringe” Turner: But
[28/10/2023, 18:56:46] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Please send any and all updates whatever transpires for you
[28/10/2023, 19:01:41] conall: that is a mega mega bummer
[28/10/2023, 19:10:16] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yes
[28/10/2023, 19:10:52] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Anyway it was your rule to not do ‘I’m tired but come over’ x
[28/10/2023, 19:14:41] conall: Sorry I had other replies
[28/10/2023, 19:14:46] conall: yes and it’s ANNOYING
[28/10/2023, 19:16:07] conall: other offers I could make but I’m just being silly cos I want to see you.

HOWEVER I assume we will see each other tomorrow or Monday
[28/10/2023, 19:18:32] conall: I hope your nose gets better. What’ve you got planned this eve? Joggers and MAFS?
[28/10/2023, 20:11:45] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m watching the Beckham doc and wondering what the 2020s are gonna look like when we start nostalgia tripping them like the 90s. Who is today’s Beckham
[28/10/2023, 20:12:00] Zoë “cringe” Turner: So yes the joggers are on
[28/10/2023, 20:12:34] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I hope the party is good if you drag yourself !!!
[28/10/2023, 20:21:24] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Shall we do Monday?? In case you’re dyin again tomoz and also cause I need to be quite ON IT on Monday day got lots of stuff to sort
[28/10/2023, 20:22:42] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Annoying cause I’ll be in Chorlton in the morning like 5 mins from you lol but then I have to go to work in the PM fumes
[28/10/2023, 20:23:04] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also this is just a love story about posh and becks they’re obsessed with each other I love it

[28/10/2023, 22:09:59] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It might actually make more sense for me to come to yours tomorrow I suppose, IF you don’t mind me staying and if we go to bed at a normal time and not 2am ????? What do you think
[28/10/2023, 22:13:16] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also think I have ringworm on my face. Not sure

[29/10/2023, 08:11:43] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also wahoo free hour sleep
[29/10/2023, 08:12:08] conall: hahahahahahaha

[29/10/2023, 12:16:59] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Definitely won’t let you know how it goes - that’s for me to know and you to find out
[29/10/2023, 12:17:38] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m WORKING fucks sake this looks sick though as if they do them all around Manchester and you don’t even need to be a pro???
[29/10/2023, 12:19:38] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Anyway yeah thanks for understanding and for asking Kate etc too, I am kind of more inclined towards Not My House for various reasons atm so I’m glad you don’t mind me being at yours but I am hoping to balance it out more when I’m in a nicer place basically. Excited to see you and to eat dumplings. If it was my house I’d even say we could eat the dumplings in bed but this is where we differ

[29/10/2023, 14:20:00] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Don’t let me eat them in bed
[29/10/2023, 14:20:52] Zoë “cringe” Turner: We will eat them in the living room like civilised people and then GO to bed
[29/10/2023, 14:30:35] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also I have a high vis originally for cycling that could be repurposed
[29/10/2023, 14:34:35] conall: nerd
[29/10/2023, 14:34:58] conall: double nerd
[29/10/2023, 14:36:34] Zoë “cringe” Turner: 🤘
[29/10/2023, 14:38:01] conall: I am very excited to be hopeless at orienteering
[29/10/2023, 14:38:35] conall: I feel like we should do some research before we go to our first competition, but it might be more fun to turn up absolutely clueless
[29/10/2023, 15:01:29] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I feel like you were actually built for orienteering
[29/10/2023, 15:01:43] Zoë “cringe” Turner: And we absolutely should do research lmao
[29/10/2023, 15:02:47] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Let’s look later
[29/10/2023, 16:12:45] conall: Thank you for the vote of confidence, I won’t let you down
[29/10/2023, 16:12:58] conall: big nerd energy coming today
[29/10/2023, 16:21:02] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Why do you keep slating me like this
[29/10/2023, 16:21:18] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I just told you you’re a born orienteering champion based on literally nothing
[29/10/2023, 16:49:46] conall: sorry it’s gone to my head
[29/10/2023, 16:51:19] conall: GOD I am sleepy
[29/10/2023, 16:51:30] conall: maybe the early darkness is making me more sleepy
[29/10/2023, 16:51:49] conall: incredibly excited to go to sleep with you tonight, and get up to absolutely nothing else
[29/10/2023, 17:27:55] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m just gonna say it
[29/10/2023, 17:28:01] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I don’t think we should watch the matrix
[29/10/2023, 17:40:15] conall: That is fine
[29/10/2023, 17:42:19] conall: we’ll watch the matrix 2 instead
[29/10/2023, 17:42:44] Zoë “cringe” Turner: :(
[29/10/2023, 17:42:46] Zoë “cringe” Turner: No
[29/10/2023, 17:42:55] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I am really early for the viewing
[29/10/2023, 17:43:03] Zoë “cringe” Turner: What shall I do in west didsbury in the rain
[29/10/2023, 17:44:59] conall: :(
[29/10/2023, 17:45:03] conall: hmmmmm
[29/10/2023, 17:45:18] conall: tbh you might just be able to text Emily and ask if you can pop round
[29/10/2023, 17:45:31] conall: if she’s not got anyone about I’m sure she’d be fine with it
[29/10/2023, 17:45:31] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I have done this
[29/10/2023, 17:45:36] conall: oh bummer
[29/10/2023, 17:46:01] Zoë “cringe” Turner: She is on her way home it’s actually fine
[29/10/2023, 17:46:09] Zoë “cringe” Turner: But I do have some awkward time
[29/10/2023, 17:46:14] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Shall I get anything from little Tesco
[29/10/2023, 17:46:23] conall: prawn sandwich meal deal
[29/10/2023, 17:46:25] conall: always a classic
[29/10/2023, 17:46:32] conall: oh
[29/10/2023, 17:46:36] conall: you meant for later
[29/10/2023, 17:46:49] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I did and then I wondered if you were serious
[29/10/2023, 17:47:41] conall: I don’t think so
[29/10/2023, 17:47:52] conall: I think the momo’s will do us nicely
[29/10/2023, 17:48:15] conall: If I knew east dids I would try to give better suggestions
[29/10/2023, 17:48:23] conall: All I know is average to poor bars
[29/10/2023, 17:49:07] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Tbh I used to live here why am I asking
[29/10/2023, 17:49:39] conall: you’ve lived EVERYWHERE
[29/10/2023, 17:49:43] conall: except Chorlton
[29/10/2023, 17:50:12] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I know! I’m so well travelled
[29/10/2023, 17:50:21] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Sophie from work was like oh you’re going to love the 111
[29/10/2023, 17:50:26] Zoë “cringe” Turner: And I was like mate
[29/10/2023, 17:50:33] Zoë “cringe” Turner: No going to about it
[29/10/2023, 17:50:59] conall: what’s the 111
[29/10/2023, 17:51:04] conall: is that a new bus to you
[29/10/2023, 18:00:26] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Not a new bus
[29/10/2023, 18:00:28] Zoë “cringe” Turner: An old bus
[29/10/2023, 18:00:33] Zoë “cringe” Turner: A friend
[29/10/2023, 18:11:30] conall: I like how your friends recognise your affinity for buses
[29/10/2023, 19:12:49] conall: No rush but give us a shout when you’re heading back up this way and I’ll head to Tibetan Kitchen to grab us some grub. Hope the viewing is going well!
[29/10/2023, 19:21:48] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hiiii I am walking back to Burton road now!
[29/10/2023, 19:22:00] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It went very well
[29/10/2023, 19:22:16] Zoë “cringe” Turner: And okay I will eat anything
[29/10/2023, 19:22:33] conall: fantastic news all round
[29/10/2023, 19:22:43] conall: see you soon
[29/10/2023, 19:30:29] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Tram in 8 mins
[29/10/2023, 19:30:41] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Shall I meet you at yours?
[29/10/2023, 19:31:50] conall: i’m just at tibetan kitchen, I think it’ll be a bit yet. I’ll text if I leave
[29/10/2023, 19:32:16] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Ok :)
[30/10/2023, 11:13:44] conall: Really sorry about how you left then, I should've been better about just getting us both up and then you could at least get some breakfast before you've gone. I know work is stressful atm for me but I shouldn
[30/10/2023, 11:13:52] conall: shouldn't keep using it as an excuse*
[30/10/2023, 11:14:26] conall: Anyway, sorry for the way you got a bit kicked out of the door. Good luck today! I hope you enjoy the viewing regardless of what your thoughts on it are
[30/10/2023, 13:20:21] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Don’t worry my love think we were both in a bit of a weird headspace, I’m sorry work is stressing you out I know it’s a shit situation to be in
[30/10/2023, 14:21:24] conall: Thanks, I need to step back a bit from it I think and just stop letting it get to me. I’ll sort it anyway. Hope your meeting goes well today. Excited to hear what choice you end up going with later, if you get some time in between all your writing stuff

Also excuse my ramblings yesterday about Emily’s place. I probably sounded much harsher about it than I intended. I DO think it’ll be a great place for you. Very exciting you’ll have this whole mess sorted soon!

Thanks for coming over yesterday, I hope you managed to get enough sleep. Enjoy your week and I’ll let you know about Friday if you’re still game?
[30/10/2023, 15:59:25] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I know but it’s hard to wanna do that and then have to open your laptop to the same thing every morning, especially when I’m there stressing too, I’m sorry about that. The meeting was fine, I’m heading home now to force the writing out wish me LUCK
[30/10/2023, 16:01:45] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It’s okay, it’s a weird situation. I didn’t like the house today and felt awful having to say so because they were both really excited about it. I’ve just been in places like it before and it doesn’t suit me, plus the painter/decorator weirdly was showing us around (no landlord in sight) and then made some weird comments about Gorton that I need to stop hearing from people. I’ve told Emily I’d be happy to take her room so I’ll see what she says
[30/10/2023, 16:03:20] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Thanks for having me and I hope today’s been okay! Yeah I am up for Friday if your pals fancy it but also no pressure
[30/10/2023, 17:57:23] conall: good LUCK

and don’t apologise for stressing! I like that you’re just honest about you’re feeling, whatever it is. If you weren’t you’d have been off anyway and I’d have thought I’d have done something. No need to apologise at all, you’re in a stressful spot atm and I hope it passes soon
[30/10/2023, 18:00:28] conall: Yeah that’s bad vibes. It did feel like you were being a bit railroaded into it and tbh that landlord sounded like a bit of a cock anyway. The whole rent raising thing is not how you wanna start off at a place.

You’ll get some stability at Emily’s place, she’s been there for a couple of years I think. AND you’ll be around your mates in an area you enjoy. All very positive. Excited for it to all get confirmed
[30/10/2023, 18:02:05] conall: Thanks for coming over with everything you’ve got on your plate, as ever it’s fantastic to see you

I’ve been on a bit of a no phone day cos I was feeling a bit AAAGH but I’ll ask them now and let you know what they say
[30/10/2023, 19:36:50] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Thank uuuuuu and yes better out than in init that’s my motto for many contexts
[30/10/2023, 19:43:10] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yeah exactly. I need to text them to let them know which is like ugh BUT someone on spareroom has just messaged me who sounds like she might fit in with them so I’ll go in with the gift of a possible replacement 

And yeah thank you for getting it, I’m really excited to be back around that part of town. Last time was in a studio where I had a distorted glass wall separating my bed from the living room and then the pandemic happened so. Also I think there are things we can do to work around any weird feelings but we can talk about that another time. It will probably just be nice for everybody in lots of respects. Not least because I would be about 20 minutes from you also
[30/10/2023, 19:45:12] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I hope you’re having a nice evening to take the stress away ???
[30/10/2023, 20:35:25] conall: I’m sure they’ll be fine with it. Obviously they’re missing out on an incredible charismatic housemate (self described), but I’m sure they’ll live

Yeah tbh I’ve been thinking about it today, and it’s just fine. I‘ve been thinking about yesterday when I was trying to articulate why I felt weird about it. It was basically just “erm I dunno weird init”. Which probably means I’m just being silly, sorry if I took a while getting here

You’re happy. Emily’s excited to live with you (spoke to her earlier). AND selfishly I will now have a nice excuse to explore Dids / Withy more. I’m really racking up my new areas these days. Great result all round
[30/10/2023, 20:38:32] conall: Just finished work and feeling a bit spent, I might just go for a wander about a bit tbh. I have made a huge cabbage and potato curry which sounds like mega peasant food but is actually very lovely OR I might have a bath and listen to this audiobook which I’m very much enjoying (I normally dislike audiobooks but this is a special case)

How’s your work gone? or if you’d rather not talk about work, how is your hopefully chilled evening going?

Also I’m a big fan of the triple ?. I won’t be using it but I really feel like I’m being properly asked a question. It’s very intense

[30/10/2023, 20:40:46] conall: I should note that Iona is not an alcoholic and the title does not refer to any actual therapy that has or will occur
[30/10/2023, 21:25:43] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Don’t pretend you don’t also find me incredibly charismatic. Also, I don’t think you were being silly, you explained things well. I just don’t think they’re things that can’t be resolved or overlooked, which is also what I think you were telling me. It’s WELL poncy in west dids. I’d actually forgotten just how poncy. Can’t wait to ponce about once more
[30/10/2023, 21:30:01] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I hope you’re having a nice time whether you’re wandering around or in the bath. Peasant curry sounds nice actually, very frugal era of you. I also had cabbage tonight, Hannah made a big winterey tea and I told her I’m LEAVING (she knew this anyway I’m just doing dramatics). The work will need to be sneakily finished in my actual work tomorrow but that’s fine nobody will know. I’ve just paid for choir retreat in Jan - very cute times ahead - and am also listening to an audiobook weirdly. 
Do you think I’m quite ?????? In real life I think I probably am but I hope it’s not bad intense
[30/10/2023, 21:31:34] Zoë “cringe” Turner: CUTE. I’m looking forward to it. And I love therapy AND drinks. So whatever
[30/10/2023, 21:35:50] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m sorry that today was a bit gross for you, I hope tomorrow is better. And I’m sorry for being intense last night and/or this morning. I don’t know why I’m so sorry today. It just felt a bit dhskdbvdjsksmaa for a hot minute. But I had fun with you AGAIN. Hope that much was obvious. Night x x x (3 x ironic)
[31/10/2023, 06:47:43] conall: Not heard the word ponce in ages. I think I thought it was homophobic so I stopped using it, and tbh I think it IS if you’re calling someone a ponce. Please advise.

And yes basically that. It’ll be great I have no doubt. 

I don’t find you charismatic I find you beguiling, we’ve been through this many times.
[31/10/2023, 06:54:32] conall: I did NEITHER. I went to bed.

Clearly Hannah appreciated your dramatics, she wouldn’t have brought out the wintery tea otherwise. Cabbage is fantastic and I don’t know why we’re all not eating it more.

That IS incredibly cute. I want to find some version of a choir but not an actual choir. My various hobbies have yielded ZERO retreats in my two years in this town. This must be addressed.

What AB (audiobook) AYLT (are you listening to do)?
[31/10/2023, 06:55:37] conall: and yes you can be a bit ??????? but I love it. It’s not intense you’re just very nice and you listen well
[31/10/2023, 07:06:13] conall: I’m laughing at this because it sounds like we both had the same day yesterday brain-wise. I felt so sorry for EVERYTHING. You weren’t intense in a bad way yesterday, the only intense stuff I remember is unrelated to anything you need to apologise for. I really appreciate you coming over what with you being so busy, I didn’t really have flashbacks yesterday because they were destroyed by stress, it seems they are back with a vengeance this morning.

Hope your day is a million times better than yesterday x (not ironic, I would like to kiss you. Cringe)
‎[31/10/2023, 12:40:20] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ‎<attached: 00002531-AUDIO-2023-10-31-12-40-20.opus>
[31/10/2023, 12:41:47] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Super cringe that you wanna kiss me !!!!! In your dreams xxx
[31/10/2023, 15:54:15] conall: LAME busy day so nerd bullet response is what you're getting I'm sorry to say. Prose can suck an egg
[31/10/2023, 15:54:34] conall: - What mealio dealio did you go for
- I feel like you just implied we Blackpudlians are homophobic
- Very fun you looked up the definition of beguiling. I meant it in the charming sense, but I do know it's associated with ships crashing on rocks. I DO feel like my metaphorical boat has been scuppered on your shores currently, however.
- The hackspace is weird for meeting people tbh. Lots of very nice but ultimately quite socially inept folk there. That sounds very harsh I know but I DID run a weekly game night there for some months a while back, sadly the games aspect was very important to those that attended and we didn't really get much socialising in.
- Adore the fact you think that not only am I aware of "Everything I Know About Love", but that I would also have ran in circles in 2018 where everyone was talking about it. I'm afraid I don't know of her, but I hope you're enjoying your hypocritical listen all the same.
- SIDDTRA,IBBNT (Sorry I didn't do the right acronym, I'll be better next time)
- WEIRD INIT. Two sorry people with nothing to be sorry for. I hope you don't cause a scene at your meal with Adam later due to your lack of shame
- Day is going bluergh. Back on the boring morning gym routine which turns out makes me feel fantastic. Work is crap but I am better equipped. ALSO I've had an idea of putting on a gamejam. Unsure of how long I'll think this is a good idea tbh, but it does sound like fun
- Funny you should mention Saturday I was asking Hannah today about what her Bonfire plans are. Kate isn't aware of anything. I'll ask Emily when I see her on Wednesday, she's good for this sort of stuff.
- Also yes I would like to see the pottery thing, we can do Blackpool when you next get a free weekend. I can get us free tickets for the Circus and possibly the whole tower so it'll be a cheap day out
[31/10/2023, 15:54:59] conall: Also don't worry I know you're being held hostage by The Time Lord or whatever (I guess you'd probably love that wouldn't you) so I don't expect a prompt response to any of this. If you'd like to ignore the above response and just call me later that's also fine
[31/10/2023, 15:55:23] conall: Actually nvm you're off out tonight and I've got work until pottery and pottery until 9:30. RATS
[31/10/2023, 21:40:13] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I am home if you fancy a chat but no worries if not, I just don’t think I have the bandwidth to reply in texts
[31/10/2023, 22:33:08] conall: Hey, soz just got this cos I forgot I turned my phone off after work!
[31/10/2023, 22:33:20] conall: You about? No drams if not. It was a LOT of texting
‎[31/10/2023, 23:30:49] conall: ‎<attached: 00002540-AUDIO-2023-10-31-23-30-49.opus>
[01/11/2023, 08:00:36] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Morning! There is no time restraint to reply to anything ever! Im really glad you’re having this meeting today, let me know how it goes. I’ll reply properly later, just on my way into work with Han. Spent FAR too much money last night, not frugal at all. Was nice to cosplay as a rich person though, never seen a bill like it. Hope you’re feeling okay 🫶
[01/11/2023, 10:36:36] conall: Had the meeting, it went insanely well! She didn’t realise how much it was getting to me cos I’m generally so “oh it’s fine” whenever something comes along. She apologised a lot and said that she’s glad I brought it up to her. Got another meeting later on to shift timelines for the two projects I work alone on to make them more manageable AND I’ve got a day off on Friday now. I assume you’re working but I can meet you after so we can have a little walk / catch up before we go to Rudy’s if you want?

Cheers for your message this morning it was very nice, I’m glad you had a fun non-frugal time. Probably extra nice now you know you’re moving to that area too. Have a good day, I like the 🫶 emoji. It’s very you
[01/11/2023, 10:38:41] conall: Also no need to reply to the essay I sent yesterday if that’s what you were referring to. I was proper hyper when I sent it and reading it back, it’s a lot. Not much in there worth addressing
[01/11/2023, 13:22:55] Zoë “cringe” Turner: That’s such good news! It’s a good job you brought it up eh. Did they give you Friday off cause of all the overtime I assume? I am thrilled for you. And yes if you wanna meet me before that’d be lovely! I should be done a bit before 5 on Friday, Dunno what time the table is for??

We were actually in town but yeah Adam is very excited for me to be back there. I haven’t heard anything from the agency though, might check in with Emily soon but also don’t wanna be all up in her GRILL yknow. 🫶 is like a heart emoji but not quite as vulnerable because you’re being a bit silly
[01/11/2023, 13:24:19] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yeah I mean I have thoughts and questions as always but not sure I can comb through all the bullet points, you should know I thoroughly enjoyed the run down though
[01/11/2023, 13:56:42] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ALSO. Exceptionally horny. As predicted. Thinking a lot about Sunday night or whenever the hell that was.
[01/11/2023, 15:41:31] conall: Yeah basically, very pleased with the outcome. I have you to thank really, your gate-gate email inspired me to be all “I’M MAD AS HELL AND I’M NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANYMORE” (possible that reference won’t land but we’ve crossed the “cringe, they didn’t get it” rubicon now I think).

Incidentally I wasn’t mad. Yknow what I shouldn’t have used that reference as it’s not apropos but it’s staying

EXCITING times ahead for the entire West Dids area. They don’t know what’s gonna hit them. She’s not even rich! She’s just faking it!
[01/11/2023, 15:42:09] conall: If there’s one thing I know about you, it’s that you can’t resist a list. No matter how rambling and incoherent it may be
[01/11/2023, 16:00:25] conall: Same. Ever since this meeting I have also been unable to get you out of my head. I think it’s cos I’ve relaxed for the first time all week.

There’s far too many things I’d like to do to you if I had the chance, but I’d mostly like to whisper in your ear and feel you droop (NOT swoon) as you hear what I’m telling you to do. I don’t think that’ll ever get old

Can’t list all the flashbacks but hearing you say “do whatever you want to me” in between moans as I fucked you, that’s what is currently torturing me at present. Thanks but no thanks for that
[01/11/2023, 18:06:12] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I didn’t get the ref but I’m very glad I inspired you and that will remain my core takeaway from this
[01/11/2023, 18:06:36] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I just love being IN THE KNOW specifically about YOU
[01/11/2023, 18:14:23] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Love this. Good luck staving that away for the rest of your evening (what are you doing this evening? See above). I’ve decided I’m officially on choir hiatus, I’m so tired I look stoned. I don’t know if I’m ill or it’s the dark or what but I’m just gonna lean into it. Currently eating mochi and kissing Moo on the head.  

Ugh. You literally COULD do whatever you wanted to me right now I am so serious. My flashback loops at present are your countdown that wasn’t a countdown it was just you being especially cruel, and getting absolutely railed lying on my front in the morning (😌) I’m sure I can still feel that
[01/11/2023, 18:47:50] conall: I will reply to the rest shortly, currently rushing.

Just thought you’d like to know your last text made me late, what you wrote turned me on so much that I had to wank while thinking of your incredible body. AND it still hasn’t made me less hard. Honestly I don’t know how you’re doing this to me.

It’s going to take all my mental energy not to turn you round and walk you back into your office when I meet you on Friday.
[01/11/2023, 19:05:14] Zoë “cringe” Turner: You thought correctly, this pleased me immensely to read
[01/11/2023, 19:31:43] conall: my reply to the above: Going Head of Steam in Dids for a pub quiz / to catch up with your new housemate before the quiz starts. It’s a bit weird to be meeting her before you’ve moved in I know, but I just thought I’d reach out and make sure you two are going to be a good fit before you sign any paperwork. I wouldn’t worry though I’m sure we’ll get on fine.

Very funny how you’ve signed up for the choir retreat and then not gone this week. I’d feel very obligated to go for some reason however that is a very silly way of thinking. I hope you, Moo and the mochi are doing okay. Maybe you’re just recovering from the sinus attack a few days ago? When I last had covid I barely slept until it passed, then slept about 14 hours for 4 night straight. Bodies are very weird. Anyway I hope it passes soon and you’re feeling yourself again.

Please fill me in on the quality cultural engagement you’ll no doubt be doing this evening. Is it a juicy joggers evening? My money is on “yes”
[01/11/2023, 20:15:57] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I don’t know Head of Steam, stop being more didsbury-literate than me. Also LOL omg. Why are you going over my head like this? How did you even get her details? While you’re there though can you clarify that Palestinian housemate conversation please 

Hahaha. That’s a very you thing to feel. I’m just like whatevs. I’ve paid my way. Also I was putting big singing shifts in all summer. And yeah possibly!!! I also didn’t sleep v well last night because I got in at half 9 and Hannah was already asleep so it threw me off and I kept thinking WHAT IF ITS NOT HANNAH IN HER ROOM and waking up startled about nothing. Also had a dream I bought a flat but it was just a caravan in Whitworth park so I couldn’t actually get in after the gates were locked. Bit of an intense experience all round
[01/11/2023, 20:19:02] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yeah juicy jogs and MAFs then I’ll shower, do some yoga, get in bed and think about your hands on/inside me probably. Very cultural evening ahead
[01/11/2023, 20:26:04] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Getting my fringe trimmed tomorrow and feel like this might’ve been a subconscious decision to impress Dan or Iona, whichever one was obsessed with it
[01/11/2023, 23:46:41] conall: Turns out the palestinian was when she was in Cyprus for a festival she was working (I did know this tbf). It’s cos she said roommate so I thought it was who she was living with. CASE SOLVED.

I absolutely love this dream. You’ll never rid your mind of this gate. Did your sooth-sayer tell you about any caravans that will be in your life in future? Maybe that’s what she meant when she said “tall man”.

Side note: I’ve never been on a caravan holiday. Something tells me they’d be boring but I LOVE camping and it’s really just fancy camping isn’t it
[01/11/2023, 23:47:37] conall: I am very excited to see the new fringe. I’m sure Dan (fringe obsessed) will also be very pleased to see it in person also.
[01/11/2023, 23:52:00] conall: The last bit was great to read but thinking of you in your yoga gear stretching about the gaff is giving me thoughts that I shouldn’t be having if I’m aiming to get to sleep any time soon. GET OUT OF MY HEAD.
[02/11/2023, 09:25:50] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Oh right that does make sense, I did think ‘room’ mate implied a transitory nature to the whole thing. Did you win the quiz ???? ???

Caravans are a bit like tall men I suppose. And yeah it is just camping but nicer because you can stay dry and cook things inside and not Poo in a hole ! Basically what I’m saying is you should buy a caravan in Whitworth park TOO
[02/11/2023, 09:26:30] Zoë “cringe” Turner: You are filth. But no, request refused
[02/11/2023, 11:29:51] conall: SEE. Better at words. I took roommate to just mean "gal I'm living with".

No quiz win I'm afraid. We came bang in the middle. Avg performance but it was a nice small team. People had very nice things to say about you, you'll be pleased to know. Things I agreed with. No one was obsessed with your fringe though.

I quite like the pig-in-shit vibe of camping tbh - also you don't need to poo in a hole you can just find a toilet somewhere. I'll ask around about caravans today and see if I can get a good spot on Whitworth Park. I'd prefer to be a bit further away from you, this is still a relatively new thing so I don't think we're ready to be living in adjacent caravans just yet. Hope you understand x
[02/11/2023, 13:15:49] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This reads a bit like I was a round in the quiz or something. But that’s really nice, rest assured I’ll be grilling you more on this tomorrow. That’s okay, the fringe isn’t for everybody 

Yeah I don’t know why I said the Poo in a hole thing, I’ve literally never done that, and I have been camping. And that’s fine, I didn’t want to be living in adjacent caravans to you ANYWAY.
[02/11/2023, 13:16:47] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also, what are you gonna do with your whole day off tomorrow? I hope it’s fun whatever it is
[02/11/2023, 14:35:47] conall: You’ll get nothing from the grilling. You’ve had your fill, and don’t you DARE grill Sleep Conall he is a tender soul. Leave him be
[02/11/2023, 14:41:11] conall: I’m gonna go for a climb in the morning (cringe), then go to the hackspace. Very very exciting day. Gonna hopefully finish the majority of this little project then it’ll just need varnishing. Praying I’ll get it done quick sharp and I’ll be able to get back to finish this very bad filter plug-in that I started last week then then wander myself over to your neck of the woods
[02/11/2023, 14:43:09] conall: ALSO meeting tomorrow, where and when? I was gonna suggest I’ll just meet you outside work but it’s a bit romcom init. I can meet you down the road to ensure neither of us are cringe in any way shape or form
[02/11/2023, 18:20:21] Zoë “cringe” Turner: But he likes me and likes talking to me and to be honest I respect his freedom of speech
[02/11/2023, 18:23:08] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I can’t believe I’m actually dating a climbing guy. Sounds EXCELLENT though. What is a filter plug-in? Does anyone know??? Not me! 

Hahahah yeah I was thinking this too, bit cringe. Also last time someone I was dating met me at work I was spotted and someone the next day was like WAS THAT YOUR BOYFRIEND and it WAS very very cringe. I could always meet you at Pev or something? Will we have time for a drink?
[02/11/2023, 18:23:55] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also: Robin got to take one of the bowls home from one of the biennial installations yesterday so I think we should demand one
[02/11/2023, 18:26:33] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also 2: I am going to Carlton club on Saturday night. I’m just going with a bunch of work people and figured you probs wanna hang with your pals that eve but figured I’d just let you know that is my plan. I have a wristband and everything, very freshers
[02/11/2023, 19:07:26] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Omg there’s an oatcake shop near the gallery, you are gonna have the full Staffs experience
[02/11/2023, 19:07:40] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Sorry this is what I’m doing in work instead of working
‎[02/11/2023, 20:28:24] conall: ‎<attached: 00002576-AUDIO-2023-11-02-20-28-24.opus>
[02/11/2023, 21:31:18] conall: It’s a plug-in that filters sounds, very dull BUT it is teaching me a lot and will hopefully be a springboard to doing other stuff.

Which reminds me I meant to mention your ???? ???? It was very funny, I enjoyed it a lot
[02/11/2023, 21:32:07] conall: And yeah deffo want to avoid this. I’ve got no idea what Pev is but it sounds like an STD. Table is booked for 6:30 so we’ve got time for a bev somewhere
[02/11/2023, 21:32:26] conall: Please ask which exhibition so we can work out who the soft ones are
[02/11/2023, 21:33:15] conall: I still LOVE the fact you call it just “an oatcake”, it never ever fails to make me laugh. But yes I want to sample all the delights
[02/11/2023, 21:34:38] conall: He will be stifled. Tape on my mouth. Hypnotherapy. Valerian root. Whatever it takes
‎[02/11/2023, 22:02:33] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ‎<attached: 00002582-AUDIO-2023-11-02-22-02-33.opus>
[02/11/2023, 22:03:24] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Forgot to say I finish at 5 tomorrow
[02/11/2023, 22:03:36] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Or maybe I already said that
[03/11/2023, 06:07:00] conall: I think you already said that but thanks. I DO know Pev, I rate it there. I’ll head there for about 5:15 and await your arrival
[03/11/2023, 06:08:51] conall: And yeah don’t worry about your vague text, it was very sweet. We can just see how we feel. I wouldn’t be sick of you I have no doubt, BUT hanging out with you and your work mates will only raise the “who’s your boyfriend” problem that you worried about earlier. Anyway, we can just play it by ear as you said
[03/11/2023, 06:09:43] conall: Incredibly tired due to mouse based issues last night. Went to be at 10pm, was woken up at around 11, didn’t get back to sleep until 1 and now I’ve woken up 😡
‎[03/11/2023, 07:37:31] conall: ‎<attached: 00002588-PHOTO-2023-11-03-07-37-31.jpg>
[03/11/2023, 07:48:27] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Oopsy
[03/11/2023, 07:48:48] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Do you wanna stay at mine tonight or is it still usable???
[03/11/2023, 07:49:04] conall: It is not usable
[03/11/2023, 07:49:22] conall: We’ll see what we’re thinking later
[03/11/2023, 08:19:25] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Okay well it’s the least I can offer as the sole person responsible for your broken bed
[03/11/2023, 08:20:05] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Unless the mouse had something to do with this in which case please take it up with them
[03/11/2023, 08:20:50] conall: Don’t you try to blame Sandy for this, she’s a valued housemate and I won’t be given ultimatums
‎[03/11/2023, 08:30:04] conall: ‎<attached: 00002596-VIDEO-2023-11-03-08-30-04.mp4>
[03/11/2023, 08:23:01] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahahaha
[03/11/2023, 08:23:16] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I love that she was mentioned as a passing thought about 2 weeks ago and I’ve heard nothing since
[03/11/2023, 08:23:21] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Now THIS
[03/11/2023, 08:33:02] conall: you and Sandy are clearly in cahoots
[03/11/2023, 08:33:34] conall: It’s like the Berlin Airlift
[03/11/2023, 08:33:42] conall: I’m onto you both
[03/11/2023, 08:33:55] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Listen
[03/11/2023, 08:35:09] Zoë “cringe” Turner: She told me she was hungry and I felt for her having ended up in a heartless home
[03/11/2023, 08:35:31] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also what if you end up LOVING mattress life
[03/11/2023, 08:35:46] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I would have to never see you again
[03/11/2023, 08:37:23] conall: I KNEW IT
[03/11/2023, 08:37:30] conall: Impossible
[03/11/2023, 08:37:53] conall: I have some decorum, my Blackpool ways don’t run that deep
[03/11/2023, 08:38:26] conall: I have ordered a new bed from Wayfare and it’ll be arriving on Monday. VERY dull but it has space for under bed storage
[03/11/2023, 08:38:31] conall: and you know what that means
[03/11/2023, 08:38:48] conall: another Ikea trip is on the cards
[03/11/2023, 08:42:11] Zoë “cringe” Turner: STOP the press
[03/11/2023, 08:42:39] Zoë “cringe” Turner: You’ve turned a bad morning into something unbeatable
[03/11/2023, 08:42:49] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I no longer have any sympathies
[03/11/2023, 08:43:01] conall: I’m literally in a fantastic mood now
[03/11/2023, 08:45:29] conall: New bed with storage
Off work today so I can give my room
a hench clean to avoid mice entering
Seeing you later (very excited for this, cringe)
No one in the flat all day and night
3 new jazz albums to listen to
Had ANOTHER idea for this filter thing that you have no idea what it is
[03/11/2023, 08:45:44] conall: honestly today is shaping up to be brilliant despite the setbacks
[03/11/2023, 08:46:13] conall: Not gonna go to the hackspace because I am very sleepy and that’s not good for using tablesaws, hasn’t dampened my mood one bit
[03/11/2023, 08:49:24] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Love all of this. Make sure you block any holes with something they can’t chew, someone at work used a tote bag to block an office mouse hole and we were like ???? Don’t underestimate
[03/11/2023, 08:51:07] Zoë “cringe” Turner: My list is currently just:
3 days off imminently
Very excited to learn about ambiguous filter thing 

SEE U LATER
[03/11/2023, 10:16:43] conall: The entrance is behind the washing machine we think. On Kate's recommendation I've ordered a "mouse hotel". Hilarious name and equally hilarious pictures on the amazon listing
‎[03/11/2023, 10:17:01] conall: ‎<attached: 00002623-PHOTO-2023-11-03-10-17-01.jpg>
[03/11/2023, 10:18:31] conall: Very funny to think not only would a mouse would stay at a hotel with little mouse porters and the like, but it would bring a suitcase comprised entirely of cheese. Had a good laugh at that this morning but I may just be delirious from a lack of sleep
[03/11/2023, 10:21:26] conall: That IS exciting. The three days off bit not the AFP (the ambiguous filter podcast). I look forward to hearing of your plans for the days I am not already aware of
[03/11/2023, 10:21:37] conall: Mega PUMPED to see you later BRO. Sorry I've just got to the gym so I have to maintain my persona or I'll be found out
[03/11/2023, 10:42:15] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This is giving man who hasn’t slept very much but it IS categorically very funny. I’m not quite sure that’s actually a suitcase, but I adore that you’ve interpreted as such
[03/11/2023, 10:43:32] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Perfect acronym skills today, delirium really gives you an edge.
[03/11/2023, 10:44:50] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahahaha. In fairness that guy who wants to be your PT could be looking over your shoulder at any moment. You too bro hope you smash that PB can’t wait to compare notes over a huge DUDE PINT👊👊👊
[03/11/2023, 12:50:36] conall: Mattress life isn’t so bad
[03/11/2023, 12:50:50] conall: Maybe I’ll cancel that order for the new bed, what do you think
[03/11/2023, 12:58:57] Zoë “cringe” Turner: 😒
[03/11/2023, 13:06:16] conall: This is you being annoyed at the fact I’ve ordered a new bed isn’t it
[03/11/2023, 13:06:45] conall: Sorry I really should’ve cleared it with you first, I know you like being as close to the ground as possible when sleeping
[03/11/2023, 13:22:47] Zoë “cringe” Turner: hahahahhaha
[03/11/2023, 13:23:32] Zoë “cringe” Turner: You know what I’m going with the ‘ew mattress’ prototype but whenever anyone has shown me a mattress they are sleeping on in a NICE flat (crucial part) I’ve thought mm looks cosy
[03/11/2023, 13:29:07] conall: Honestly it is pretty cosy
[03/11/2023, 13:29:12] conall: See what you think later
[03/11/2023, 13:29:20] conall: But you have to PROMISE you won’t get the ick
[03/11/2023, 13:32:45] Zoë “cringe” Turner: But I would want a massive 10,000 tog mattress
[03/11/2023, 13:32:52] Zoë “cringe” Turner: And like 5 pillows
[03/11/2023, 13:32:58] Zoë “cringe” Turner: So not sure
[03/11/2023, 13:33:01] Zoë “cringe” Turner: About your set up
[03/11/2023, 13:33:08] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Always quite sparse
[03/11/2023, 13:33:20] conall: sparse she says
[03/11/2023, 13:33:25] conall: honestly
[03/11/2023, 13:33:34] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It is sparse
[03/11/2023, 13:33:39] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Like a desert bed
[03/11/2023, 13:33:43] conall: you’re sparse
[03/11/2023, 13:33:57] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also I have brought no stuff because you told me your bed was broken at 7.45 when I was leaving for work
[03/11/2023, 13:34:16] conall: reasonable
[03/11/2023, 13:35:07] conall: well it’s totally up to you
[03/11/2023, 13:35:32] conall: we can go back to yours if you’d rather, I just suggested mine cos no one is in and it seems you generally like to be out of your place if you can be
[03/11/2023, 13:36:11] conall: OR we can go back to mine then go to yours in the morning so you can get changed before we head to beautiful downtown stokeland california
[03/11/2023, 13:36:29] conall: plenty of options, all fine with me
[03/11/2023, 13:37:24] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Let’s discuss later, I might also have a free house / need to feed Moo
[03/11/2023, 13:37:50] Zoë “cringe” Turner: As desperate as I am, Conall, to sleep on your mattress bed
[03/11/2023, 13:37:58] conall: You don’t sound desperate
[03/11/2023, 13:38:18] conall: Not feeling the desperation through these texts I’ll be honest
[03/11/2023, 13:38:23] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Do you want the cat to starve
[03/11/2023, 13:38:40] conall: No of course not I am a lover of all animals
[03/11/2023, 13:39:00] conall: in THAT case
[03/11/2023, 13:39:05] conall: I will bring “stuff”
[03/11/2023, 13:39:37] conall: A Rudy’s Rucksack
[03/11/2023, 13:40:22] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It is your turn to have to carry stuff around
[03/11/2023, 13:40:34] conall: I love carrying stuff
[03/11/2023, 13:40:42] conall: Makes me feel like a MAN
[03/11/2023, 13:40:49] conall: “Hey everyone, I’m USEFUL”
[03/11/2023, 13:40:51] Zoë “cringe” Turner: And feel conspicuous
[03/11/2023, 13:41:04] conall: I can’t remember what conspicuous means
[03/11/2023, 13:41:16] conall: use easy words please I am tired
[03/11/2023, 13:41:24] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Makes me feel burdened
[03/11/2023, 13:41:53] conall: like Atlas, I will carry the weight of the world (a chance of clothes) on my shoulders tonight

[05/11/2023, 23:46:43] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I do find it strange that when we matched I had a bit of a like unusual intrigue, not to be all tarot card about it
[05/11/2023, 23:46:53] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Lmao I knew you weren’t being serious
[05/11/2023, 23:46:55] Zoë “cringe” Turner: GOD

[05/11/2023, 23:48:55] conall: but suffice it say we were all in agreement that this was probably going to go well. Unsure why tbh. Something in the air about it
[05/11/2023, 23:49:57] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Do you think it’s cause your opening line was about old man farts and I just went with it
[05/11/2023, 23:50:10] conall: That was part of it probably
[05/11/2023, 23:50:20] conall: You just seemed engaged I guess

[06/11/2023, 08:59:26] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hi!! Where do you climb? I only started a few months ago but I’ve found it’s such a good way to challenge myself outside of the 9-5. Wonder if we’ve been doing the same routes haha
[06/11/2023, 09:00:06] Zoë “cringe” Turner: You can punch me if you want to 😉

[06/11/2023, 10:00:43] conall: I was going to attempt to carry on this bit but you've just done it too well
[06/11/2023, 10:01:02] conall: the "haha" at the end, "outside the 9-5"
[06/11/2023, 10:01:18] conall: You really hit all the marks
[06/11/2023, 10:01:22] conall: Top work.
[06/11/2023, 10:01:52] conall: ALSO I don't get messages that are this horny except for that one girl who thought me using a lathe was 🥵
[06/11/2023, 10:02:30] conall: It's the only place you need to go
[06/11/2023, 10:03:10] conall: Wanna go there on Friday
[06/11/2023, 10:14:25] conall: I thought this was a good thing but you're actually making me shrink stop it!!!!
[06/11/2023, 10:17:03] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Ahahahahaha give over
[06/11/2023, 10:17:14] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Omg love saying give over like I’m 80 years old
[06/11/2023, 10:17:41] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Thanks :)
[06/11/2023, 10:18:25] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I feel like you think about this message quite often. Maybe you should’ve replied ????
[06/11/2023, 10:18:43] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Question or statement?
[06/11/2023, 10:19:04] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I literally can’t stop thinking about having sex with you lmao
[06/11/2023, 10:19:44] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Me in the dentist chair but really in flashback city
[06/11/2023, 10:20:00] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also £50 to tell me my teeth are fine what the hell
[06/11/2023, 10:32:59] conall: shut UP I've mentioned it twice and only when appropriate
[06/11/2023, 10:34:05] conall: I'm a fully realised human being Zoë, not just a man who makes bowls!!!
[06/11/2023, 10:34:37] conall: Very annoying but much better than not going, I haven't been to the dentist in over a year and I feel like I probs should
[06/11/2023, 10:37:03] conall: Same it's awful. Already came once this morning and I STILL can't stop thinking about you. There's too much to think about from this weekend it's breaking my brain a little bit. You're so unbelievably hot my tiny mind can't cope
[06/11/2023, 11:08:53] Zoë “cringe” Turner: hahahah whatevs!!
[06/11/2023, 11:16:39] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I think a year is fine, get them cleaned annually and you’re A ok is the vibe I get. I always tell mine I can’t floss very well silly me😇😇 like that when I go and they’re always like lol just try your best xoxox
[06/11/2023, 11:17:31] Zoë “cringe” Turner: How did you even have anything left this morning that’s AMAZING

[06/11/2023, 12:48:56] conall: Yeah v fair. Do you get a scale and polish? Idk if my dentist is rough but it proper cuts my gums up, leaves my teeth feeling FANTASTIC though
[06/11/2023, 12:49:32] conall: idk honestly. You just have this effect on me and I couldn’t POSSIBLY work out why you drive me so wild
[06/11/2023, 12:49:40] conall: exhibit A
[06/11/2023, 12:50:35] conall: Jesus christ you’re hot. I can’t wait to give that thing more bruises

[06/11/2023, 16:09:18] conall: I love them what are their names
[06/11/2023, 16:09:33] conall: big fan of the left ones hairdo, obsessed with that fringe
[06/11/2023, 17:29:51] Zoë “cringe” Turner: hahaha don’t I’ll get fringe envy
[06/11/2023, 17:30:12] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I think these ones were Elton and Wigbert
[06/11/2023, 17:32:01] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I tried walking Elton for a bit but got too scared
[06/11/2023, 17:32:49] Zoë “cringe” Turner: / annoyed cause he just wanted the granola and kept pulling me through the mud
[06/11/2023, 17:35:58] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Alpacas distracted me from this for a short while but now I’m mentally involved once more
[06/11/2023, 18:15:55] conall: greedy Elton
[06/11/2023, 18:16:13] conall: They look adorable, was it good catching up with your mate? (I’ve forgotten her name)
[06/11/2023, 18:18:54] conall: How do you think I feel?! I’ve not had any alpacas to distract me from your pic all day. My screen time is through the roof because I can’t stop opening my phone and looking at it. “I want this on my face” is literally the only thought that has been in my head since 11am
[06/11/2023, 18:19:14] conall: Also I’d like very specific details on what being “mentally involved” entails for you tonight
[06/11/2023, 18:54:18] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yes so good!! Love her a lot. And she seems happier now she’s been away since losing her dad and everything. It was so foggy up there though when we were driving back in the dark Robin had to hold my hand cause we could hardly see lmao
[06/11/2023, 18:55:09] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Now I am home and can see and Aaron is fixing the bathroom door :’) maybe Jacob will start doing housework for you soon
[06/11/2023, 19:06:12] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ‘I want this on my face’ wassss kinda what I was angling for not gonna lie. I’m very glad to have succeeded. This seems only fair when I am wanting to sit on your face most of the time
[06/11/2023, 19:20:32] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m gonna be thinking a lot about the filthy things you tell me about myself, like how well I take your cock and how good I’m being for you, and the things you make me say that you wanna hear like how much I want your tongue inside me. I love it when you make me say what I want because you already know. I wish I could listen to you talk to me like that constantly. But I can’t so I’ll just be remembering it all while I’m sleepy but not so sleepy that I won’t start touching myself, thinking about how stupidly wet I was when you made me come with my arse in your face, and how wet I get just having you in bed with me because it’s like it’s my default just to want you. Is that specific enough?
[06/11/2023, 20:21:18] conall: That's great to hear. I honestly can't imagine what it must be like going through that, it's one of those world shaking things that I imagine you never really get over.

Very cute thinking about you and Robin being all scared in the car together though
[06/11/2023, 20:22:12] conall: Ooooooh now THAT is exciting. I look forward to using it. Jacob has gone back to Nottingham! Kate DID tell me she was meeting a guy from Notts but I forgot this. Shame really. They seemed to get on very well but she said they probs won't see each other again
[06/11/2023, 20:24:30] conall: I am often thinking it, but that picture has really pushed out any other thoughts I have about you. Honestly when you said you'd send pictures I don't really know what I was expecting, certainly not that it would have this kind of impact on me. Unless it's not clear already, you're unfathomably sexy
[06/11/2023, 20:32:34] conall: One of my absolute favourite things to do is get you to do the dirty talk. You're just so eager to please, it's really quite amazing how submissive you get when I want you to be. This message is like a window into your horny little brain and I love every word of it. I hope you enjoy making yourself come thinking of my voice, tongue and cock tonight. I've said it before but I can't stress enough how much that picture has turned me on today, I can't stop thinking of all the things I want to try on you next.
[06/11/2023, 21:29:52] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Oh no way!! Dating long distance is a bit lamo isn’t it but what if they’re MEANT to be
[06/11/2023, 21:40:36] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Okay well this is great to know as that one was very low effort / I can show you more when you want it
[06/11/2023, 21:50:06] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I had some spare time before MAFS started right and I was GOING to read a book but just kept reading this message instead lol. I absolutely love being submissive for you and I really want to hear what things you’re thinking of trying right now but maybe you should save that for next time you’re in my ear and I can’t move anywhere. I also can’t stop thinking about you whimpering underneath me when you’re desperate to be touched, I want more of that
[06/11/2023, 22:21:56] conall: This is what I said! I said she should do a romcom thing but I wasn’t equipped to say which romcom thing she should do. Suggestions welcome
[06/11/2023, 22:24:56] conall: I was going to say just send them whenever you want, because I really enjoyed the surprise and I didn’t want to inconvenience you (lol aren’t I dumb)

BUT that’s clearly stupid, because I know you, and if there’s one thing I know you like it’s being told what to do by me. I’d like another picture of your bum, ideally before you go to bed but if you’re too sleepy I don’t mind waiting. I want it looking as sexy as you can make it. Panties on or off, your choice.
[06/11/2023, 22:26:18] conall: ALSO I dislike using the word panties cos it just sounds funny to me, but PANTS is a stupid word and “knickers” is old lady vibes. Suggestions welcome. Thanks in advance for indulging my thesaurus questions
[06/11/2023, 22:27:52] conall: Love everything about this message. You won’t hear any of my plans until the next time I’m pinning you to the bed. I know you’ll like them, I want to feel your pussy twitch as I tell you what I’m going to do to you.
[06/11/2023, 22:37:50] conall: Slightly more wholesome message but related to what you said (excuse the whiplash in this string of texts), I ALSO enjoy you making me whimper. I enjoy it a lot, yes to more of it and I look forward to any way you want to make me whimper in future.

It’s nice to explore that part of me because I haven’t really before. It’s not only incredibly fun but also great that I feel so comfortable with you. In a less trusting environment I’d probably feel like I’d come across as weird / worried about icks for you making me realise I enjoy being a little bit submissive at times. Idk a lot of dynamics going on there that we could chat about, but for now just wanted to say thanks for not only being great IN bed but also out of it too
[07/11/2023, 07:03:50] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Lots of Skyping, as if Skype was still the default video call app. Old fashioned AND yearnsome. Also, now that I know he came from Notts, the books make slightly more sense…. They were probably talking about them before he came here, so he brought them with him to show?? This is a very date I would do when I was 17
[07/11/2023, 07:07:05] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Well, best of both worlds here - I was too sleepy and cold to do this before I went to bed but now that you’ve set me the assignment I can do this whenever I want and keep you guessing when it’s gonna be. So thank you for this, rest assured you’ll get what you asked for
[07/11/2023, 07:09:30] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Ugh this is such an age old question for my own brain. Panties is fine. I think you said it the other day and I thought it was hot so. There are no winners here really, we just have to pick one and double down
[07/11/2023, 07:10:14] Zoë “cringe” Turner: 😩😩😩😩😩😩
[07/11/2023, 07:19:24] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahaha, this message is actually so indicative of why you turn me on so much though, because there’s this kind of fluidity to the way we are around each other that means sex is like a part of the whole vibe rather than being a separate thing, so when you talk about it in relation to the other stuff like being comfortable etc it’s just EVEN MORE sexy. Anyway that was a tangent: that makes me really happy to know, it’s also something I’ve not really explored before that I’ve always wanted to and you make it feel very possible but in a no pressure let’s work this out together kind of way. I find the idea of you giving up to me incredibly hot, don’t worry
[07/11/2023, 07:19:36] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also morning, hope you have a lovely day
[07/11/2023, 09:06:39] conall: Hadn’t thought of Skype in a yearning context but I do agree with your assessment. Something about the nostalgia of it I think.

Apparently The Fall was Kate’s, she hadn’t ever read it but bought it in Paris. The Steinbeck one was his though and he was reading it on the train.

Loves young dream right there I tell ya
[07/11/2023, 09:07:42] conall: I had a feeling this might be the way this worked out and I am incredibly pleased it has
[07/11/2023, 09:07:51] conall: Panties it is
[07/11/2023, 09:19:39] conall: Yeah I think the same. I’m sure we’ve both been in situations where it’s either the “sex time” or the “not sex time”, the barrier seems fuzzier with us and not in a “we just talk about sex constantly like Horse Girl and Big Dick Tom”. One flows into the other in a way that I really enjoy. I can only speak for myself but I’m really enjoying this whole thing.

And yeah that’s my thoughts on it too. The “no pressure let’s work this out together” thing is a very nice way of putting it. I’m glad that I can make these things possible for you, and I hope you know I feel the same about you.

Also “giving up to me” is one of those things that I know is going to be stuck in my head all day. UGH.
[07/11/2023, 09:21:29] conall: Thank you! I hope you do too. I’ve had a somewhat productive morning. Cycled to the hackspace to fix my bike / pick my bottle up, then clattered to the ground on the way home because apparently the council thinks it’s a good idea to put very slippy metal strips on a bike lane. Incredible foresight from them. White cords have taken the brunt of it but I think I should be able to sew them back together
‎[07/11/2023, 09:21:43] conall: ‎<attached: 00002959-PHOTO-2023-11-07-09-21-43.jpg>
[07/11/2023, 10:13:40] conall: ALSO forgot to ask how YOUR morning was
[07/11/2023, 12:10:56] Zoë “cringe” Turner: The words of someone who has never yearned via Skype; emotionally immature imo. Ah okay so he was like HOW HAVE YOU NOT READ IT YET and proceeded to begin for her? Hahaha
[07/11/2023, 12:13:42] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Omg Big Dick Tom has been DUMPED (spoiler) so I think their sex obsession was all a farce (shock) and maybe his dick isn’t even that big. But yes that is exactly what I meant with us, I love it loads. It just feels like there’s space for everything yknow. Makes me happy
[07/11/2023, 12:16:05] Zoë “cringe” Turner: NOOOOOO awful :( is your leg okay???? This looks like a savlon job for sure. Maybe it looks more dramatic because white trousers??? I hope it’s not too bad!
[07/11/2023, 12:17:06] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also what kind of ground clatterer are you, do you feel like you have to laugh?? Or do you just make AGH noises and quickly brush down and hope nobody notices
[07/11/2023, 12:19:33] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I don’t tend to fit as much into my mornings as you but I’m feeling good. Currently in greasy spoon waiting for eggs, everyone else seems to have clocked on to said greasy spoon which is a shame cause it’s busier than usual but I still have a nice window seat. Today’s my job is stupid drama is: we need to move the chair in Gallery 9 because the radio signal isn’t stretching to where it’s positioned but VTA thinks passionately otherwise because new chair position is ‘weird’. Could you be arsed
[07/11/2023, 14:11:04] conall: I yearn! (relevant: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERsI3twlu34). Very lame of me to be like "here's this video of what I'm referencing" but you're *always* chatting on about the perception gap
[07/11/2023, 14:12:10] conall: I think SHE was trying to impress him, because he's a big reader, but honestly I can't tell. She is (jokingly) in love with him but I think that's just because it isn't going to work. We did have a DMC (I learnt this last month) about it though. Very nice all round
[07/11/2023, 14:13:05] conall: I watched MAFS last night! I knew of the dumping. I think it's because his dick is TOO big. That's my current theory anyway.

Last couple of sentences made me very happy. I have nothing to say other than I agree lots and lots
[07/11/2023, 14:15:47] conall: It's got a decent cut on it but it'll heal! I am a bit bruised I think? I can't tell. I DON'T bruise easily unlike some so unsure of what the damage will be. Funny you mention "types of clatterer" because I realised today I've changed! I used to be a silent, grit teeth and go "oooooooffff" under my breath. Today however, I shouted FUCK really loud and very quickly as I hit the ground. I didn't realise my voice could get that loud. It then made me laugh as I got up because if I was looking at me hurtling towards the ground whilst swearing, I'd find it quite funny
[07/11/2023, 14:16:53] conall: I could NOT be arsed with this day. The greasy spoon sounds nice though. I'm imagining you in the Apprentice cafe where the losing team goes, please don't shatter my illusions. I hope chair-gate is being resolved and the VTA has managed to direct their passion into something more productive for themselves

[07/11/2023, 16:43:11] conall: this is very much not a side note
[07/11/2023, 16:43:31] conall: I consider this to be a main note, or whatever the other kind of note is
[07/11/2023, 16:44:47] conall: I keep trying to write a reply to this but I can’t
[07/11/2023, 16:47:59] conall: Insanely hot that you took a break from work to take this for me. You look so fuckable. I can’t wait to spank you until you scream tomorrow
[07/11/2023, 18:22:32] Zoë “cringe” Turner: You don’t have to say much, I just wanna know I’ve done what you asked for but it sounds like I have
[07/11/2023, 18:22:44] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Is yours gonna be free??
[07/11/2023, 18:23:07] Zoë “cringe” Turner: About to see that ‘how to have sex’ film lol will feedback on tips
[07/11/2023, 19:36:48] conall: I have no notes. It was the best surprise
[07/11/2023, 19:36:58] conall: Yeah, Kate’s teaching until 9:30/10
[07/11/2023, 19:37:07] conall: oh fantastic we could do with some help I think

[07/11/2023, 21:09:29] Zoë “cringe” Turner: What time are you free from tomoz???? *??????* wish I could caps question marks
[07/11/2023, 21:10:37] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It actually was about horrible boys on a girls holiday to Malaga or wherever so just tips on how NOT to do it sorry !!!
[07/11/2023, 21:11:26] Zoë “cringe” Turner: How many have u made already??!! They look so smooth I want to stroke them
[07/11/2023, 21:14:14] Zoë “cringe” Turner: New Theory: Wanting what you can’t have = biggest perception gap. I actually had to ask Robin what a DMC was, but GREAT I want a secondhand debrief because I’m nosey af
[07/11/2023, 21:15:44] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m watching LIVE RIGHT NOW and I’m on the edge of my seat for Big Dick Tom on the couch. Can’t wait to see Ros cry about just how big his dick was. This bit is awful but I can’t stop
[07/11/2023, 21:17:40] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Interesting! It’s like you’ve come out of your clatterer shell. I think it’s probably better to vocalise that a catastrophe is happening rather than try to repress something very obvious. I wonder if I’d have found it funny if you were a stranger
[07/11/2023, 21:18:24] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Gemini is actually very apprentice cafe lmao, the eggs were very over cooked and sad. Not sure why I love that place so much
[08/11/2023, 03:20:55] conall: highly annoying. Tried to get to bed early last night (9:30) cos I was mega tired. Woke up at 2:30. Can’t get back to sleep now either even though I’m living in sleepy city. LAME.
[08/11/2023, 03:23:14] conall: I’m pretty sure I’m free from about 1ish. Could meet in town at 2pm, go to the art gallery, then head back to mine after to make some food

OR we could go to Shogun Ramen actually let’s do that I fancy some

[08/11/2023, 10:33:58] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also I think you may have accidentally sent me an erotic audio in the last 2 mins of that voicenote bloody hell
[08/11/2023, 10:34:14] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Do you wanna meet at 1??
[08/11/2023, 10:38:48] conall: hahahaha
[08/11/2023, 10:39:14] conall: don’t worry about it honestly, I’m very used to it now. It WILL be sorted I promise. Sorry to keep banging on about it
[08/11/2023, 10:39:58] conall: lmao I have no memory of what I said. I am not gonna re-listen cos I’ll cringe at whispering horny Conall
[08/11/2023, 10:40:04] conall: sounds ace

[08/11/2023, 10:57:12] conall: Yeah fair point. I think I’m just boring myself with it tbh, so many headaches and all that. ALSO someone sent an article to a group chat about Alzheimer’s and lack of sleep which is now constantly on my mind. Awful move to read that

[08/11/2023, 13:43:44] conall: I told the driver “I am meeting my _friend_ at an art gallery!” but they didn’t listen
[08/11/2023, 13:43:50] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahahahaha

[08/11/2023, 13:47:13] conall: ESPECIALLY in the high pressure env of a tram exchange
[08/11/2023, 13:47:26] conall: normally I’m pretty good at it
[08/11/2023, 13:47:28] conall: but that one
[08/11/2023, 13:47:34] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I feel like you do get strangely stressed about tram doors though

[08/11/2023, 13:49:18] conall: “look I said mate before but that’s just a social convention so I don’t have to say ‘person I am dating’, could you hurry it up please”
[08/11/2023, 13:49:27] Zoë “cringe” Turner: hahahahahahaha
[08/11/2023, 13:49:30] conall: and he said “that social convention is stupid” then pressed on the pedal to go

[08/11/2023, 13:50:01] Zoë “cringe” Turner: You’re having a very eventful journey
[08/11/2023, 13:50:11] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hm maybe I’ll go to SUPERDRUG first
[08/11/2023, 13:50:15] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Not sure what that was caps

[08/11/2023, 13:51:22] Zoë “cringe” Turner: a northern quarter puddle?

[08/11/2023, 13:52:21] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I actually don’t know because you LOVE Christmas
[08/11/2023, 13:52:40] Zoë “cringe” Turner: but I’m definitely not going because I hate them
[08/11/2023, 13:52:51] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Regret even making the joke
[08/11/2023, 13:53:02] conall: so confused as to what the joke is
[08/11/2023, 13:53:12] conall: candidate 1
[08/11/2023, 13:53:16] conall: candidate 2
[08/11/2023, 13:53:21] conall: i’m leaning 2
[08/11/2023, 13:53:28] conall: 20% chance of 1
[08/11/2023, 13:53:43] conall: no, 10%. It’s an underdog let’s put it that way
[08/11/2023, 13:54:54] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This was the joke
[08/11/2023, 14:04:22] conall: disappointed in my guess there
[08/11/2023, 14:04:28] conall: I KNEW about the christmas thing
[08/11/2023, 14:04:40] conall: but thought maybe you would like the markets for some reason
[08/11/2023, 14:04:42] conall: unsure why
[08/11/2023, 14:05:24] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yeah weird that

[09/11/2023, 08:59:16] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahahahahha erm excuse me
[09/11/2023, 08:59:37] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Unnecessarily taunting ‘joke’ to send this
[09/11/2023, 08:59:51] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also just did some of my best staff room chat
[09/11/2023, 08:59:56] Zoë “cringe” Turner: In response to how’re you I said
[09/11/2023, 09:00:09] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ‘All good now I’ve had my coffee!!!!!’

[09/11/2023, 09:01:03] conall: Fantastic
[09/11/2023, 09:01:27] conall: Are you going to talk about the weather for a bit?
[09/11/2023, 09:01:34] conall: It IS very cold today
[09/11/2023, 09:01:41] conall: notably so
[09/11/2023, 09:01:50] conall: That aught to get you a good five minutes of chat
[09/11/2023, 09:05:37] conall: lastly before I get off to work
[09/11/2023, 09:05:48] conall: this is nowhere near the levels of taunting I've experienced this week
[09/11/2023, 09:05:50] conall: so SHUT IT
[09/11/2023, 10:15:34] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Stop staff room chatting me
[09/11/2023, 10:16:48] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I MEAN when I’ve just had to leave your bed and you send me a photo of one of my FAVOURITE places to touch ????? Bit high taunt really
[09/11/2023, 10:19:00] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Let’s either go and see Bottoms or Scorsese tomorrow? I know you wanted to see Scorsese, and I’m partly intrigued, however John (whose film opinions I trust) has informed me that he saw it last night and gives it literally no stars
[09/11/2023, 10:19:58] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m struggling with the concept of just a date in town at this point I’m gonna be honest. It’s making me a bit agitated
[09/11/2023, 11:05:11] conall: tehe
[09/11/2023, 11:07:03] conall: Honestly not arsed about Scorsy. I was gonna see it cos heads were going but I might have given the wrong impression
[09/11/2023, 11:07:41] conall: Somewhat VERY bored of the Scorsy / Caprio / De Niro combo. It's FINE but who cares
[09/11/2023, 11:07:49] conall: Let's go see Bottoms
[09/11/2023, 11:08:35] conall: Listen, I'm a single guy. This is what you get
[09/11/2023, 11:36:54] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Cause heads were going lol
[09/11/2023, 11:37:11] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Okay yeah let’s go have a LAUGH instead of being harrowed/needing a wee for 4 hours
[09/11/2023, 11:37:40] Zoë “cringe” Turner: We can see it at HOME at 3.30 orrrr printworks at 5.45
[09/11/2023, 11:38:58] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Oh yeah sorry that reminds me

[09/11/2023, 14:44:58] conall: I think it's partially the good night's sleep, and partially because I think we cranked up the saying nice things that we think about each other (cringe)
[09/11/2023, 14:46:23] conall: I also think this about you, I can't really say much more because I'll BORE myself. There's only so many ways to express how pleased I am with this whole thing AND it's really nice that we can just say that to each other without being all "oh my god it's only been X amount of time I can't say I'm ENJOYING it"
[09/11/2023, 14:46:48] conall: honestly waiting with baited breath here, I was getting palpitations in the office
[09/11/2023, 16:23:29] Zoë “cringe” Turner: How was it ???
[09/11/2023, 16:28:01] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahaha yes I know that we’re doing the whole YUCK CRINGE thing because it’s funny and I was about to be like ‘might crank it down next time to keep you on your toes’ but I fundamentally cannot do this, I can’t be cool anymore, you’ve ruined my cool, it’s GONE.
[09/11/2023, 16:28:41] Zoë “cringe” Turner: So yeah, anyways. Excited to see you tomorrow 😂
[09/11/2023, 16:29:35] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Unsurprising, sorry for not replying sooner. The chair has been moved to what is now colloquially known as Parrot Corner. A corner of the room where there is a glass case of parrots (unsure of their relation to Durer’s work tbh). This has been the compromise
[09/11/2023, 16:32:22] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ALSO, yesterday made me realise our exhibitions here are SO GOOD compared to everywhere else. You should come one day. But not yet because half the gallery is currently closed lol and it will seem like we’re just as shite as esea
[09/11/2023, 16:36:54] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Look how rude this email is

[09/11/2023, 16:37:35] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Agents are so cringe. Also everything she has just listed as the strenuous admin is: their job
[09/11/2023, 19:25:01] conall: very pleased about this
[09/11/2023, 19:25:08] conall: also you were never cool lamo
[09/11/2023, 19:25:13] conall: lame-o?
[09/11/2023, 19:25:19] conall: unsure of how that is spelt
[09/11/2023, 19:25:36] conall: AS AM I ZOË
[09/11/2023, 19:25:43] conall: butterflies already
[09/11/2023, 19:26:36] conall: Oh thank god. Really pleased everyone, including the parrots, have got what they wanted out of this situation. Bless you all
[09/11/2023, 19:26:41] conall: hahahahahahah
[09/11/2023, 19:26:50] conall: omg they’re so put upon aren’t they
[09/11/2023, 19:27:22] conall: They LOVE explaining admin to tenants. They honestly think so little of anyone who rents, it’s so obvious whenever you interact with them
[09/11/2023, 19:30:45] conall: I had a similar annoyance with one a while ago, they were trying to take my whole deposit and I said at the end of an email “it’s no wonder estate agents aren’t seen as a pillar of the community”
[09/11/2023, 19:30:53] conall: the IRE that I drew for that comment
[09/11/2023, 19:31:36] conall: How’s YOUR evening going? Well I assume now that chairgate is out of the way
[09/11/2023, 19:32:32] conall: Lots of chatter about this £50 in the group chat from Emily and co. Very shit all round. I only paid £25 for my tenancy swap (Adam didn’t pay anything). I think it’s just the agent charging the literal maximum they can (or maybe it’s not legal honestly I don’t know)

[09/11/2023, 20:59:04] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Honestly hate their attitudes so much. Also the person we had to send money to was called GASCOIGNE
[09/11/2023, 20:59:31] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I think anyone called GASCOIGNE has enough going for them already Nevermind our 50 squid don’t you

[09/11/2023, 21:51:00] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Isn’t that AWFUL
[09/11/2023, 21:51:11] Zoë “cringe” Turner: so basically I understand
[09/11/2023, 21:51:36] Zoë “cringe” Turner: And yeah call me I’ll just be reading in bed 😌
[09/11/2023, 22:19:47] conall: cringe
[09/11/2023, 22:25:26] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Omg has your phone died
[10/11/2023, 09:31:22] conall: MORNING. Hope you had a good sleep. Just wanted to send a celebratory text because I woke up at 4am today, then went BACK to sleep until 8am. THEN read in bed until 9pm. A total of 9 hours chill time. SOME might say "oh but it's broken sleep, it's not ideal" but I DON'T CARE
[10/11/2023, 09:50:00] Zoë “cringe” Turner: YEEEEEEEAH
[10/11/2023, 09:50:29] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I love this
[10/11/2023, 09:50:38] Zoë “cringe” Turner: What was your trick?????
[10/11/2023, 10:28:18] conall: I think it was literally just being harsh with myself
[10/11/2023, 10:28:24] conall: Just being like "NO"
[10/11/2023, 10:28:37] conall: I was awake for about 45 minutes and it took ages to get back to sleep, but that's okay
[10/11/2023, 10:29:29] conall: ANYWAY
[10/11/2023, 10:29:33] conall: How was YOUR sleep
[10/11/2023, 11:55:50] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Lmao just shouting at yourself
[10/11/2023, 11:56:00] Zoë “cringe” Turner: No I think patience is the key
[10/11/2023, 11:56:29] Zoë “cringe” Turner: My sleep was great! I did set a few alarms, ignored all of them, woke up a bit before 10
[10/11/2023, 11:57:12] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I can’t help but be luxurious
[10/11/2023, 11:57:25] conall: Absolutely love it
[10/11/2023, 11:57:36] Zoë “cringe” Turner: And in my defence I’m about to work 7 days straight again (ugh) but have asked for next Friday off to make it 6

[10/11/2023, 11:58:00] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I know

[10/11/2023, 11:59:42] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It’s a nice day
[10/11/2023, 12:00:15] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I was planning on getting there before you and reading and looking really nonchalant and intelligent when you walked in but Nevermind
[10/11/2023, 12:00:34] conall: No I'M going to do that
[10/11/2023, 12:00:46] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also was gonna ask if you wanted to come back to mine and just chill for a bit afterwards/make some food
[10/11/2023, 12:00:57] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Then I’ll Chuck you out at bedtime

[10/11/2023, 12:25:06] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I just wanna make food for work and pack my bag to stay at James’s afterwards and be cosy that’s all

[10/11/2023, 12:39:08] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Oh my fucking god

[10/11/2023, 12:42:08] conall: Well I'm very glad to be on the receiving end of it
[10/11/2023, 12:42:19] conall: Very fortunate timing on my part
[10/11/2023, 12:42:43] Zoë “cringe” Turner: also unfair because nobody has done this the other way

[10/11/2023, 12:59:47] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I was enjoying being well received !!!!!!
[10/11/2023, 13:02:59] conall: hahahahahaha
[10/11/2023, 13:03:11] conall: I did say basically what you said
[10/11/2023, 13:21:16] Zoë “cringe” Turner: You can ask them if they wanna come to the party with you if you want??? I know it might be a bit far for them and you don’t really know your plans yet though, but the offer is there
[10/11/2023, 14:07:23] conall: omg I might be late to my “sitting in HOME looking intelligent” appointment

[11/11/2023, 12:00:38] Zoë “cringe” Turner: what are u doing with ur day
[11/11/2023, 12:15:00] conall: you said “this perfume enhances your natural scent”
[11/11/2023, 12:15:09] conall: but obv you said it in a “well this is bullshit” sort of way
[11/11/2023, 12:15:30] conall: SO if this jumper has the perfume on it AND it smells like you
[11/11/2023, 12:15:32] conall: you know what
[11/11/2023, 12:15:35] conall: never mind
[11/11/2023, 12:15:47] conall: it’s not the greatest joke in the world, it doesn’t warrant this explanation
[11/11/2023, 12:16:02] conall: just at the hackspace (I can tell you where that is if you need to know)
[11/11/2023, 12:16:09] conall: then going to DO ONE later
[11/11/2023, 12:16:16] conall: unsure what I’ll do in between
[11/11/2023, 12:16:21] conall: feeling LISTLESS
[11/11/2023, 12:40:25] conall: ‎You deleted this message.
[11/11/2023, 12:41:12] conall: OOPS
[11/11/2023, 12:41:20] conall: tell me if you saw that pls don’t lie
[11/11/2023, 12:41:56] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I didn’t
[11/11/2023, 12:42:03] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m on a Jessie Ware walk
[11/11/2023, 12:42:15] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Was just vibing
[11/11/2023, 12:42:29] Zoë “cringe” Turner: WHAT WAS IT
[11/11/2023, 12:43:07] conall: thank FUCK
[11/11/2023, 12:43:15] conall: it was nothing.
[11/11/2023, 12:43:24] conall: nothing at ALL.
[11/11/2023, 12:45:38] Zoë “cringe” Turner: You’re so sus
[11/11/2023, 12:45:43] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This is a red flag
[11/11/2023, 12:46:36] conall: don’t you dare
[11/11/2023, 12:47:26] Zoë “cringe” Turner: 😜
[11/11/2023, 12:51:40] conall: I will say at some point I PROMISE
[11/11/2023, 12:51:45] conall: well not say
[11/11/2023, 12:51:50] conall: but you see what I mean
[11/11/2023, 12:52:36] conall: Unsure what the biggest cringe from yesterday was, here’s my two contestants:
- Hannah walking into the kitchen
- You trying to book a date in for 2029 or whenever it was
[11/11/2023, 12:52:38] conall: hehe
[11/11/2023, 12:53:00] conall: also I’ve had Charlie XCX on all day and I’m having a fantastic time
[11/11/2023, 13:07:46] Zoë “cringe” Turner: 😒😒😒
[11/11/2023, 13:07:58] Zoë “cringe” Turner: OBVIOUSLY Hannah in the kitchen
[11/11/2023, 13:08:28] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I don’t plan more than a week in advance so don’t know what you’re on about anyway. I go where the wind takes me
[11/11/2023, 13:08:52] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Spelt her name wrong though awks
[11/11/2023, 13:09:05] Zoë “cringe” Turner: No. 1 Angel is genuinely one of my fave albums I think
[11/11/2023, 13:09:07] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Lmao
[11/11/2023, 13:09:18] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Bangs so hard 🥹
[11/11/2023, 13:09:33] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Wish I could be listless today
[11/11/2023, 13:54:49] conall: I liked it. Made me feel very 😎 and 😯
[11/11/2023, 13:55:21] conall: WHATEVS. I will not be looking up the correct way
[11/11/2023, 13:57:20] conall: Love the image of you bopping about to Roll with Me looking obviously incredibly cool
[11/11/2023, 13:58:36] conall: I HATE IT. Hate this feeling. Although today has been productive. Back home from the hackspace but now going back into town cos I fancy a veggie break and I need to go to abakan or however you spell it
[11/11/2023, 13:59:28] conall: Also can’t believe how effective your Aaron well poisoning was. Been thinking all day “why did I dislike him so much?”, weird for me tbh cos I normally like most people. I blame you
[11/11/2023, 14:16:49] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Nice emoting here
[11/11/2023, 14:17:09] Zoë “cringe” Turner: hehehe
[11/11/2023, 14:18:51] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I know I know but we should try and embrace it, doesn’t come round often enough and also imagine having a life where you can just be like: guess I’ll go for a veggie breakfast at 2pm???? I assume this is what you meant anyway. And you don’t have to imagine it. You’re just doing it
[11/11/2023, 14:19:34] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I dunno if you get this thing but honestly so often I will just be like ‘wow as if I can just decide what to do with my days and my life now and nobody can stop OR question me’
[11/11/2023, 14:19:40] Zoë “cringe” Turner: and I’m obsessed
[11/11/2023, 14:19:46] Zoë “cringe” Turner: not over it
[11/11/2023, 14:20:05] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also what time will you be in town until
[11/11/2023, 14:21:12] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Ugh don’t make me feel bad about it!!!!!!! He’s fine
[11/11/2023, 14:25:17] conall: WHENEVER
[11/11/2023, 14:25:18] conall: why
[11/11/2023, 14:25:52] conall: *?????
[11/11/2023, 14:27:03] conall: just got to koffee pot
[11/11/2023, 14:27:07] conall: ordered my breaky
[11/11/2023, 14:27:08] conall: loving this
[11/11/2023, 14:28:12] conall: thanks for saying this because too often I forget it. With all the dumb hobbies / very mild obligations I have set up over the last two years I often feel like I have no time for ME.

Turns out, it’s ALL me time. I’m doing these things cos I like them. Very lucky to have the ability to do this stuff

Anyway thanks for the reminder
[11/11/2023, 14:28:22] conall: what’s this ABOUT i demand to know
[11/11/2023, 14:45:35] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Omg chill

[11/11/2023, 14:46:10] Zoë “cringe” Turner: But like don’t hang around
[11/11/2023, 14:46:16] Zoë “cringe” Turner: If you’re not around
[11/11/2023, 14:46:25] Zoë “cringe” Turner: No worries lol just asking for a mate x
[11/11/2023, 14:47:59] conall: I’d like that
[11/11/2023, 14:48:03] conall: so nonchalant
[11/11/2023, 14:48:31] conall: were you eating when you typed this?
[11/11/2023, 14:50:03] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yeah x
[11/11/2023, 14:50:49] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ok wanna meet me somewhere near the library and walk around with me a bit before I cross the river into Salford ?
[11/11/2023, 14:51:03] Zoë “cringe” Turner: weirdly specific date idea
[11/11/2023, 14:51:27] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I will leave in an hour
[11/11/2023, 14:54:50] conall: the big library?
[11/11/2023, 14:55:01] conall: I’m on my bike so I can meet you anywhere
[11/11/2023, 14:56:14] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Ok well it’s up to you if u wanna kill time and come down Oxford road or just meet me at the top by Big Library yeah
[11/11/2023, 14:56:39] conall: I’ll do the former
[11/11/2023, 14:56:48] conall: Very good suggestion
[11/11/2023, 14:58:30] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yay
[11/11/2023, 15:29:34] conall: fantastic result
[11/11/2023, 15:29:43] conall: free veggie break

[11/11/2023, 17:42:42] Zoë “cringe” Turner: hehe didn’t actually realise until I’d done it
[11/11/2023, 18:00:26] conall: STELLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[11/11/2023, 18:01:10] conall: Kate is v jelly of your jessie ware trip

[11/11/2023, 18:09:05] conall: oh also meant to say, Weds I’ve got a cheap tickets code to that afrique de circ thing at factory
[11/11/2023, 18:09:17] conall: unsure if anyone else is going but we can go if you fancy it
[11/11/2023, 18:09:31] conall: but we can chat about it another time

ENJOY YOUR NIGHT BYE
[11/11/2023, 18:22:08] Zoë “cringe” Turner: She’s HUGE !!!!!!! Dunno why you weren’t excited for me tbh
[11/11/2023, 18:22:32] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Unsure if I trust factory anymore but I will look into it
[11/11/2023, 18:23:26] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Ryan thinks you’re a loser for walking with me
[11/11/2023, 18:23:33] Zoë “cringe” Turner: BYEEEEEEEEEE
[12/11/2023, 08:26:30] conall: omg you went to see Jessie Ware?!?!?! so jelly. I LOVE her stuff. She is an icon
[12/11/2023, 08:27:27] conall: “I will look into it” who do you think you are
[12/11/2023, 08:27:40] conall: Tell him that I agree
[12/11/2023, 08:27:45] conall: I’m a sap
[12/11/2023, 08:27:52] conall: A loser
[12/11/2023, 08:28:21] conall: A lame-o
[12/11/2023, 08:29:04] conall: I would NEVER normally be like “omg yes a WALK across the busy town centre?!”
[12/11/2023, 08:29:40] conall: I have clearly lost my cool as you have. Hacks me off
[12/11/2023, 08:35:29] conall: also I hope work is not too lame today, I had a dream about the parrot corner last night so thanks for introducing that to my brain

[12/11/2023, 11:20:35] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This is hilarious, what is there even to dream about parrot corner
[12/11/2023, 11:20:55] Zoë “cringe” Turner: A MELT some might say
[12/11/2023, 11:21:32] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yeah I don’t know that was quite rude wasn’t it sorry hehe
[12/11/2023, 11:24:50] Zoë “cringe” Turner: My mate Jessie covered Believe by Cher and mysteriously appeared up on the balcony behind us and the crowd went WILD. Big moment. Also I think I must’ve been quite drunk because I thought some guy walking home called us gaybods or something that nobody would even say, so I was all like U WHAT MATE and he was like David!!!!! Like in a schitts creek voice and I was like oh lol that’s actually quite funny don’t worry about it!!!!! This is a pointless story though cause you don’t watch TV
[12/11/2023, 13:09:13] conall: I LOVE this
[12/11/2023, 13:09:26] conall: raises so many questions
[12/11/2023, 13:09:33] conall: I need to hear more about Leonardo!
[12/11/2023, 13:10:23] conall: Love calling people melts, haven’t done that in a while. Need to reintroduce
[12/11/2023, 13:11:35] conall: that IS a big moment. I am informed by people I was with yesterday that Jessie Ware is “an icon” and “absolutely amazing”, so I’ve clearly missed the boat here. Very glad you saw her on the balcony and presumably on the stage at some points too
[12/11/2023, 13:25:18] conall: Not pointless I liked it, but I don’t understand it I don’t think. Was the guy just calling you David? Being called a gaybod is a very funny insult to make up though, it’s like something a primary school kid would say. Sounds like a banging eve. How’s your head doing today?

[12/11/2023, 20:22:41] Zoë “cringe” Turner: choose wisely
[12/11/2023, 20:23:08] conall: right now right now !!!!! !!!!!! !!!!!!
[13/11/2023, 07:41:11] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Morning !!! Hope you feel better today / that this morning goes well and that Greg is okay. I just had an egg and some blueberries which is I think what some people might call a champion breakfast. 🫶

[13/11/2023, 12:42:54] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hiiii how are you feeling post funeral?
[13/11/2023, 12:44:13] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I did the facilitation! Thank you for my chant, it went pretty well I think and most likely because I listened to that beforehand like it was a Shia Labeouf motivational vid
[13/11/2023, 12:45:36] Zoë “cringe” Turner: At one point I was like ‘and Refrigeration releases F gases which is pretty mad really because we use fridges so much’ - someone who knows what she’s on about
[13/11/2023, 13:20:18] conall: Hiya! Doing good thanks. Very sad day all round but glad I was there to give Greggle some support. He was really appreciative so can’t say better than that. Just on the train back now, I was gonna hang about for my mum to get home from work but she’s in bed v ill, so I just popped in with a load of fruit and a tube of berocca’s. Now I’ve got a FREE evening which I’ve got incredibly exciting plans for
[13/11/2023, 13:23:35] conall: Wahey! Proud of ya. How did the staff like it? Did it go as you expected? (People saying “this is pointless cos what can we do”)

I have no idea what F gasses are, I assume the F doesn’t mean “fridge” though. Explaining this to me is not a pressing concern so don’t worry about it

Very pleased for you x (not ironic, not cringe, just a guy being honest with his x’s so get off my BACK alright)
[13/11/2023, 14:45:39] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Aw I bet he was so relieved you were there, bless him. Hope he can get some closure now etc. Horrible horrible!! And poor YOUR MUM. Do beroccas actually work do you know or are they merely a false hope??? Either way you did good

‘Incredibly exciting plans’ is such a cliffhanger. DO YOU WANT ME TO ASK CONALL? Because I am asking what they are
[13/11/2023, 14:46:06] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Omg just checked who blindboy’s guest is and it’s Johnny marr hahahahahhahaha
[13/11/2023, 14:46:15] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Dunno whether to cringe or not
[13/11/2023, 14:51:08] Zoë “cringe” Turner: There has been a bit of that but they’ve also been open and solutions based, it’s just working out how we take those solutions further than our team, which is next steps!! Can’t do that til we’ve done this so I think it’s positive. Thank u 😌 - I am not gonna try and explain what F gases are. A) I don’t really know b) I’m off the clock 

Xxxxx (neutral)

[13/11/2023, 16:05:41] conall: omg
[13/11/2023, 16:07:55] conall: I am instinctively cringing but I do that for most “oh it’s manchester aren’t we so manc yeah manchester wooooo” bands / people. Idk why

I PRESUME however that blindboy is a good interviewer so even if it’s cringe it’ll be cringe in a way that you’ll enjoy
[13/11/2023, 16:08:04] conall: hahahahahaha
[13/11/2023, 16:10:24] conall: Very very exciting. Also meant to ask, did you enjoy it? I feel like you’d be good at these sorts of things but you seemed v apprehensive
[13/11/2023, 16:10:44] conall: Also I used the double question mark today in a text. Very cringe behaviour on my part
[13/11/2023, 21:02:43] Zoë “cringe” Turner: omg Conall I’ve had to leave cause I was falling asleep lmao
[13/11/2023, 21:03:04] Zoë “cringe” Turner: :( lane
[13/11/2023, 21:03:10] Zoë “cringe” Turner: LAME
[13/11/2023, 21:03:29] Zoë “cringe” Turner: but literally I’ll just hear it on the poddy
[13/11/2023, 21:04:24] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Only double ????????
[13/11/2023, 21:05:12] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I kind of enjoyed it, I have mixed feelings about these things cause my personality is half please look at me half please don’t
[14/11/2023, 07:03:56] conall: hahahahahaha oh dear. Was it because it was dull or you were just sleepy? Did Connor stick it out?
[14/11/2023, 07:36:49] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It was a combo + 3 accidental pints beforehand. And yeah he bumped into his pal so he wasn’t on his own ahaha
[14/11/2023, 08:03:09] conall: Ahh good you didn't totally bail on him then. I love hearing about these things, it's a little glimpse into another world. All these people out there, reading Dolly Alderton, listening to Blindboy. What ELSE are people getting up to?
[14/11/2023, 10:52:46] Zoë “cringe” Turner: How was your eve??
[14/11/2023, 13:05:27] conall: It was good thanks! I was going to go to the hackspace but that wheezing that you pointed out last week has got a bit worse, so I stayed in and wrote (brace for cringe) some 3 month goals LOL. Who do I think I am
[14/11/2023, 13:10:28] conall: Big news for the Whovies (I think that's what you said they're called)

https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/nov/11/lost-doctor-who-episodes-found-owner-reluctant-to-hand-them-to-bbc
[14/11/2023, 14:36:37] Zoë “cringe” Turner: That isn’t cringe, I like stuff like this. You are a man about to take control of his life
[14/11/2023, 14:38:09] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I think the big news here (for me) is David Tennant returning as dr who on my birthday. Very surprised my dad hasn’t said anything about this yet
[14/11/2023, 15:12:38] conall: It felt like one of those lame "I'm a super life optimiser guy 😎" things but that's just me being silly. It's very very nice to have it all written out so I can actually be a bit more structured with my life instead of running round like a headless chicken. This chest thing has got me a bit concerned though, I'm gonna go to the GP tomorrow. Sorry if I've seemed a bit off the last day or so, it's not intentional I've just been a bit out of it x
[14/11/2023, 15:13:14] conall: I was going to give you a birthday present but I think it'll pale in comparison to this
[14/11/2023, 17:04:50] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Naaah. I think it’s good for grounding and redirecting etc. I do that kinda stuff when I feel a bit adrift so I hope it helps if you’ve been feeling that way!! 

And yeah, going to the GP sounds like a plan if you’re worried. It might be nothing / just related to being run down recently though. That’s alright don’t worry, do you still wanna do something tomorrow?

[14/11/2023, 20:18:28] Zoë “cringe” Turner: So I did a workout and now I’m just watching old episodes of the L Word and just witnessed an actor’s face being blurred out like as though they’ve asked to no longer be in the show they were in in 2004 or whenever? I didn’t know that was a thing but it’s very funny
[14/11/2023, 20:19:38] Zoë “cringe” Turner: and yeah I’ll just come to yours after work then, I also don’t really want to do anything!
[14/11/2023, 20:19:51] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Question: do you have any meetings Thursday morning?
[14/11/2023, 20:50:34] conall: You can rant if you want, don't worry about boring me. I'm just reading so if you wanted to call and talk about that or anything else, I'm about. No drams if not tho, I totally get what you mean about boring yourself with it, or you might just wanna switch your brain off a bit. One way or another this will be over soon, I'm sorry you've got to put up with this shite in the meantime
[14/11/2023, 20:50:59] conall: Also no meetings on Thursday, I shifted my cal about this morning thinking we can finally get the "you have a shower, I'll make some eggs" thing down. How come?
[14/11/2023, 21:12:15] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m just finding it especially hard this week, not sure why, but I don’t think he’s left since like Thursday or something and I think I’m maybe struggling most with the lack of communication from Hannah, it makes me feel like I’m always on the back foot and being pushed out of things. Not that I’m making much of an effort myself with him but idk you know the vibe, I don’t really want to. He actually asked me a question tonight and it was just ‘hey Zoe do you have *insert this thing I need* ???’ mega cringe. ANYWAY I think it’s also hard cause I know it’s bringing up anxieties I have that aren’t really anything to do with him per say, which seems unfair of me. But yes getting out soon, sorry for being a mope
[14/11/2023, 21:15:02] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Oh fab well I’m not in work until the afternoon on Thurs so I was wondering if you had room to manoeuvre and chill with me for a bit and sounds like you do which is nice 🥹
[14/11/2023, 22:12:10] conall: Nah you've got no reason to feel like you're not making the effort. It's his job to do that, anyone with half a social brain realises that if you're in someone's home you need to at least be vaguely interested in the people that live there. ESPECIALLY if you've just moved in yourself as he is. It's shit but clearly he's just one of those guys. I hope Hannah and him are happy but I don't get a good vibe off him tbh. I wish I could offer more than the odd night at my gaff and a vague "it'll be over soon" platitude
[14/11/2023, 22:20:01] conall: I was already excited to see you but this message has made me very happy indeed. I've got some fun plans for tomorrow evening. v v v v v v v excited
[15/11/2023, 06:49:24] Zoë “cringe” Turner: IM VERY EXCITED TOO

[15/11/2023, 12:26:33] conall: fantastic
[15/11/2023, 12:45:37] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Someone at work has just given me the scoop on a curry place called Coriander in Chorlton and I actually started salivating but that might be cause I’m quite hungry
[15/11/2023, 12:45:49] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Anyway apparently there’s two and one of them is good and one of them is bad
[15/11/2023, 12:46:20] Zoë “cringe” Turner: We should go to the good one at some point please
[15/11/2023, 14:19:26] conall: I've had a butch at one in the centre and it's giving me real "Blackpool curry house that thinks it's classy" vibes but in a way I'm really enjoying
[15/11/2023, 14:19:54] conall: Let's do that one. My hunch says it's the bad one but I've not seen the other
[15/11/2023, 15:27:39] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I think they both this give vibe by the sounds of it; the good one is the one by the crematorium at southern cem :) great vibes
[15/11/2023, 16:00:55] conall: why do I STILL have two hours to wait 😡
[15/11/2023, 16:01:21] conall: (I am not angry at you I am angry at THE WORLD)
[15/11/2023, 16:24:54] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Don’t worry I’ve been mad all day
[15/11/2023, 17:06:27] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m on the bus now so I’ll only be like 20 mins
[15/11/2023, 17:14:34] conall: This is tremendous news
[15/11/2023, 17:24:47] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Stuck in traffique

[16/11/2023, 13:15:10] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahahahah what

[16/11/2023, 13:16:17] conall: Hiya mate! Any chance of me bringing Zoë along tomorrow eve? She’s Emily’s new housemate funnily enough. No drams if you’ve not got the space for plus ones
[16/11/2023, 13:16:30] conall: actually this is verbatim so this doesn’t apply
[16/11/2023, 13:16:50] Zoë “cringe” Turner: LOL
[16/11/2023, 13:16:58] Zoë “cringe” Turner: this isn’t entirely clear I’m a person you’re dating
[16/11/2023, 13:17:08] conall: KK you’re in
[16/11/2023, 13:17:09] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Kind of just reads like you want to bring Emily’s housemate
[16/11/2023, 13:17:15] conall: Nah it’s fine
[16/11/2023, 13:17:18] conall: Who cares
[16/11/2023, 13:17:34] Zoë “cringe” Turner: That was easy
[16/11/2023, 13:17:35] conall: It’ll be come apparent later or it won’t it’s IRRELEVANT

[16/11/2023, 13:19:01] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yeah it’s Greek
[16/11/2023, 13:19:12] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also why loads of futuristic brands keep using it
[16/11/2023, 13:19:14] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Like that car
[16/11/2023, 13:19:29] Zoë “cringe” Turner: And that film called Zoe that is about AI
[16/11/2023, 13:19:31] conall: Didn't realise
[16/11/2023, 13:19:51] conall: I let my subscription to Zoë quarterly lapse
[16/11/2023, 13:20:15] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Don’t do that again x
[16/11/2023, 13:20:17] conall: I've got an in with one of them now, don't really need the magazine

[16/11/2023, 13:21:35] conall: (and yes it was a date)
[16/11/2023, 13:21:56] conall: Honestly I didn't realise about the concept of quality time, or at least not in the same way
[16/11/2023, 13:22:00] conall: Totally on board now
[16/11/2023, 13:22:09] conall: Yesterday was QUALITY time
[16/11/2023, 13:32:24] Zoë “cringe” Turner: You were born for quality time Conall
[16/11/2023, 13:32:31] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Glad to have enlightened you
[16/11/2023, 13:32:36] Zoë “cringe” Turner: To this fact
[16/11/2023, 13:33:17] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I know you don’t want me to thank you but I’m very grateful for yesterday
[16/11/2023, 13:33:47] Zoë “cringe” Turner: / all the days tbh but yesterday especially
[16/11/2023, 13:38:11] conall: Honestly don't worry about it at all
[16/11/2023, 13:39:07] conall: I really enjoyed it, you looked like you were having the best time
[16/11/2023, 13:41:08] conall: It was very emblematic of the whole fluidity thing that you talked about before. It wasn't just a sex thing it was something much nicer than that. I'm bungling the words but you get what I mean I hope
[16/11/2023, 17:51:16] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I just wanna be back there to be honest
[16/11/2023, 17:53:00] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yes I very much get what you mean. LOVE. IT. LOVE. YOU.
[16/11/2023, 17:53:53] Zoë “cringe” Turner: How is the rest of your day??? I got told off for yawning too much in a meeting 🥲

[16/11/2023, 18:59:56] conall: Literally all I've thought about today is last night, had to move the massage oil off my desk cos it was DISTRACTING lmao
[16/11/2023, 19:00:09] conall: love YOU also DUH
[16/11/2023, 19:01:40] conall: I thought you might get the sleeps quite a bit, I'm very tired and that's not really like me so you must be knackered. ALTHOUGH I do think it's illness related because I went for a swim earlier and had to stop after two lengths because I was so shattered. Bath tonight and a read is on the cards. I hope your day has been just as frustrating as mine has
[16/11/2023, 19:02:37] conall: crumbs this does look very interesting but also yeah pretty rough to view atm. I really hope it goes as well as it can and you've not got to field angry / incredibly upset people for the next month or so
[16/11/2023, 19:08:49] conall: also lol at me saying crumbs, not said that in a bit. Very Grandma of me
[16/11/2023, 19:38:31] conall: ALSO
[16/11/2023, 19:38:35] conall: you left your book
[16/11/2023, 19:38:45] conall: ALSO can't deal with these flashbacks
[16/11/2023, 19:43:54] Zoë “cringe” Turner: You were like maybe the closest you’ve ever been to my body by way of it being in slow motion for a drawn out period of time
[16/11/2023, 19:44:31] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Didn’t I tell you I wanted to die it was so hot at one point? Still true
[16/11/2023, 19:44:52] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I know and this is sad cause tomorrow was gonna be a reading day
[16/11/2023, 19:45:03] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Oh well I have lots of books
[16/11/2023, 19:46:51] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Omg maybe do a covid test or is it too late???? Maybe you’ve had a flu. Swimming is the most knackering, I love being post swim hungry it’s the same as post sex hungry I’ve just realised. Hope you get a big sleep tonight. Thinking about you saying ‘I miss logs’ in your sleep lmao
[16/11/2023, 19:47:29] Zoë “cringe” Turner: CRUMBS yeah we’ll have to see how it lands I think. Everyone is very tense atm
[16/11/2023, 20:07:21] conall: UGH
[16/11/2023, 20:07:28] conall: I had forgotten this
[16/11/2023, 20:08:23] conall: I just keep thinking about when I was at the head of the bed, running my hands down your body, and you trying you best to lick as much of my cock as you could as it passed your mouth. It's a very difficult image to get rid of
[16/11/2023, 20:10:43] conall: I think it's a bit late now but whatever it is has proper sped through my body this week. I feel mostly fine now just very congested and tired. Just running a bath now, can't wait to get in it. I hope you manage to get a good sleep tonight also. I really do want to know what I was dreaming about when I said the logs thing, very busy evening for this stupid brain
[16/11/2023, 20:11:12] conall: Got my fingers crossed for ya. How's the vibes at work this eve? I'll be honest I really don't envy this bit of your job at ALL
[16/11/2023, 20:51:21] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Omg stop it I loved having you in my face like that soooo much 😩
[16/11/2023, 20:51:59] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also you know when you put your cock inside me?? I feel like it’s the 😩 face I make hahahaha
[16/11/2023, 20:53:18] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Well hopefully you’re over the worst now then and you can have a fun weekend after lots of RESTING. No idea about the log thing. I do wanna be inside your head sometimes
[16/11/2023, 20:56:29] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This eve is fine, extremely quiet, I have just cleaned my desk for the last 45 mins
[16/11/2023, 20:56:33] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Omg but
[16/11/2023, 20:56:40] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Our cleaner this morning killed a baby mouse she found
[16/11/2023, 20:56:50] Zoë “cringe” Turner: By pouring boiling water on it ?????????
[16/11/2023, 21:14:58] conall: It was so hot when you were asking me to take my boxers off, you really wanted to taste it. UGH insane
[16/11/2023, 21:15:46] conall: hahahahaha it really does. I LOVE your face in all it’s many forms but this one is a top three Zoë face for sure
[16/11/2023, 21:16:18] conall: I’ve gone for a walk cos I had a bath and was about to go to bed then Camus and Kate came back and started fucking SO LOUD
[16/11/2023, 21:17:05] conall: Kinda awks so I just snuck out cos I wasn’t gonna sleep anyway, I like a nighttime walk regardless
[16/11/2023, 21:17:14] conall: wtf?????????? this is fucked
[16/11/2023, 21:27:50] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hehehe
[16/11/2023, 21:28:29] Zoë “cringe” Turner: CRINGE I’m never being quiet again (unless you are telling me to in a way I am not supposed to argue with)
[16/11/2023, 21:29:41] Zoë “cringe” Turner: You can’t mess with Pam. She iced me out the other day because I radioed her about a pile of debris she’d forgotten about. She’s kinda hilarious. I did laugh at the mouse story but mainly out of nervousness
[16/11/2023, 21:30:07] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hope you’re having a nice walk !!!!
[16/11/2023, 21:30:22] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m on my way home ready to do a mega sleep
[16/11/2023, 21:30:36] Zoë “cringe” Turner: No Camus keeping me awake tonight
[16/11/2023, 21:30:43] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Tomorrow? Probably a different story
[16/11/2023, 21:37:23] conall: it is a bit cringe, especially after Kate was all “omg how embarrassing you could hear us ICK”
[16/11/2023, 21:38:17] conall: Hahahahahaha tbf you’d be getting the cold shoulder from me if you radio’d me about some debris. Keep
your debris to yourself love
[16/11/2023, 21:39:55] conall: it’s a bit rainy but I am enjoying the walk thanks. In an incredibly good mood, glow in full force. Just well chuffed (which I’m sure you’ll find funny)
[16/11/2023, 21:41:09] conall: V jealous of your sleep though. No doubt you’ll sleep for about 600 hours. Hope you’re feeling a bit better about your situation now you’ve got the referencing form x
[16/11/2023, 22:17:50] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Lol what the hell 💔 you’re supposed to care about all my debris !!!!!
[16/11/2023, 22:18:51] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Chuffed to bits aren’t ya. This makes me v v v v happy and I can’t wait to see u again already
[16/11/2023, 22:20:02] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yeah the house is empty rn and I’ve filled in the form, had to get a reference from my manager and he did it within like 5 mins earlier so yay🤞🤞🤞🤞

[20/11/2023, 20:29:51] conall: also
[20/11/2023, 20:29:58] conall: tell me you’ve gotten changed
[20/11/2023, 20:39:15] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Nah
[20/11/2023, 20:39:30] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Think I’ll wear the same thing to work tomorrow
[20/11/2023, 20:39:42] Zoë “cringe” Turner: To assert dominance
[20/11/2023, 21:04:03] conall: hot
[20/11/2023, 21:04:11] conall: but also probably a bit smelly
[20/11/2023, 21:04:26] conall: lmk if you need some detergent or if I can buy you a meal deal x
[20/11/2023, 21:11:17] Zoë “cringe” Turner: What am I supposed to do with detergent when I don’t have a home
[20/11/2023, 21:11:26] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Pour it on myself and stand in the rain?
[20/11/2023, 21:11:39] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also your washing machine sounds like it’s got a horrible old man cough
[20/11/2023, 21:11:47] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Something I observed this morning
[20/11/2023, 21:20:53] conall: not my business I'm just looking to feel good about myself, stop bringing the vibe down
[20/11/2023, 21:21:01] conall: hmmmm
[20/11/2023, 21:21:25] conall: I haven't noticed this but i will point my ears at it next time it's running
[20/11/2023, 22:15:41] conall: UGH I was going to go to sleep but you won’t leave my head. I can’t stop thinking about how hard you came this weekend, and how wet you seem to be constantly. It’s madness. Incredibly glad you’ve wormed your way into my psyche
[21/11/2023, 08:25:22] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This is one of those definite reread all day messages. I’d say I don’t know how I’m like that all the time around you but I know how you make me feel so that would be a lie. It makes sense but it is ridiculous

[21/11/2023, 10:24:15] conall: You're not sorry I can hear it in your voice 😡
[21/11/2023, 10:26:35] conall: My evening was good, didn't go back to the hackspace, didn't make soup. Just had a bath (I'm loving my bath era) and finished off this Frank Burly book, got another that I might crack out later. Busy busy day today but it's ALL fun stuff. Except work but frankly even that's fun these days
[21/11/2023, 10:27:22] conall: Also I hope I don't come across as dismissive of your sleep regime, I am incredibly envious. I am currently green (like this🤢 but not sick)
[21/11/2023, 10:28:07] conall: Give me a rundown of what's going on with you
How's shugs
How's parrot corner
How are you generally feeling (eg: fibro / other stuff)
[21/11/2023, 12:52:41] Zoë “cringe” Turner: FUN. Question: was Viv in the bath too???
[21/11/2023, 12:53:18] Zoë “cringe” Turner: listen I’ve got a CHRONIC condition that requires absurd amounts of R&R
[21/11/2023, 12:53:28] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Lol no I need to stop saying that
[21/11/2023, 12:56:03] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’ve been a bit annoyed since I got to work because I was late and it was my own fault and then I immediately had to go to a 2 hour meeting that didn’t have anything to do with me BUT…
There were mince pies and coffee
AND I think this contract is done and dusted and YEAH feeling good about that 
Today though I’m really worried about getting ill before Saturday. Everyone just seems to have some lurgy and I don’t want it ✋✋✋✋✋I want to party

[22/11/2023, 10:36:27] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Sorry I’m really not doing well at retaining what you’ve said while replying but I do know what you mean about your body being a well - could even say we were both deepin it. Deep like a well.

[22/11/2023, 13:28:21] conall: HELLO
[22/11/2023, 13:28:35] conall: Sorry been actually working all day, cringe or what
[22/11/2023, 13:28:54] conall: I've had this on this morning and it's been delightful
[22/11/2023, 13:29:14] conall: I'll send a vn back in a bit x
[22/11/2023, 13:55:45] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Sooooooo CRINGE
[22/11/2023, 13:56:03] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hehe. Today is so these vibes. Happy daylist
[22/11/2023, 14:32:35] conall: loved this
[22/11/2023, 14:34:55] conall: thanks for the moo/shuggs update. That book sounds v good tbh but yeah B L E A K.

Your voice notes ARE much more interesting than mine. I love the different voices you have. My favourite is Sleepy Zoë but that’s just because you sound quite sexy. SUE ME.

What’s your plans tomorrow? You’re working right? Got a monkey’s paw / devil’s bargain / sophie’s choice if you’re able to get to mine for 5pm
[22/11/2023, 14:35:35] conall: Hope you’re enjoying Levs, get it in while you can. What’s your plans later????????
[22/11/2023, 15:06:59] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Was that last one sleepy me ???? Wanna know if I’m sexy when still in bed at 10am on a Wednesday
[22/11/2023, 15:07:45] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m working and won’t be able to get to yours til 5.30 :(((( but I still want the monkey choice bargain please
[22/11/2023, 15:09:10] Zoë “cringe” Turner: No plans! I’m gonna make a stew now then find something to busy myself with
[22/11/2023, 15:16:33] conall: No it wasn’t, but it was sexy for other reasons. But I’m not just gonna sit here and list all the times that I think you sound sexy cos that’d be: a) cringe 2) lame and cringe
[22/11/2023, 15:16:40] conall: big bummer
[22/11/2023, 15:17:14] conall: the choice was:

5:30 table at BAD coriander, but we get half price

regular table at GOOD coriander, but we pay full price
[22/11/2023, 15:17:46] conall: Kate mentioned that it’s on that free table app or whatever it’s called, but ONLY the bad one is there. Shows you how well they’re doing I guess
[22/11/2023, 15:36:38] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Oh right :/
[22/11/2023, 15:37:15] Zoë “cringe” Turner: WELL I can probably meet you AT bad coriander for half 5 or just after if you get there first like a big keeno to make sure they know we’re serious people ????
[22/11/2023, 15:38:06] conall: omg even though that emoji is likely a joke it’s still killing me inside
[22/11/2023, 15:38:28] conall: kk let me investigate, I’m pretty sure it was 5:30. Need to double check
[22/11/2023, 15:39:05] conall: also if you’d like me to detail the ways in which I found this last voice note sexy I’d be fine to do that. Just don’t wanna be a bit MUCH ya know
[22/11/2023, 15:39:54] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Omg I was joking
[22/11/2023, 15:40:08] Zoë “cringe” Turner: LOL imagine ????
[22/11/2023, 15:40:37] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Conall you tell me things like this constantly and I love it but remember words of affirmation is only my third LL it’s fine xx
[22/11/2023, 15:41:22] conall: hahahahahaha
[22/11/2023, 15:41:32] conall: I was mostly joking in my last message
[22/11/2023, 15:41:41] conall: I didn’t expect you to say yes
[22/11/2023, 15:42:07] conall: I’ll let you know about corrie
[22/11/2023, 15:42:38] conall: don’t know why but for some reason I’m VERY excited to see tomorrow. Like more than usual. Been proper HYPED all day

[22/11/2023, 15:52:05] conall: pretty good we had that convo last week, imagine giving a present to a girl you’re just DATING when you’re actually still single and it’s all mega caszh
[22/11/2023, 15:53:11] Zoë “cringe” Turner: cute !!!! lol
[22/11/2023, 15:53:44] Zoë “cringe” Turner: They don’t even know who you are yet actually best fill them in
[22/11/2023, 15:54:17] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Thought you weren’t getting me a present cause I love Christmas so much you can just combine them
[22/11/2023, 15:54:27] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Don’t build me up for disappointment please
[22/11/2023, 15:54:35] conall: No you’re getting a lump of coal for Christmas
[22/11/2023, 15:54:43] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yeah awkward
[22/11/2023, 15:54:50] conall: I want to really reinforce your distaste for the season
[22/11/2023, 15:55:00] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also thanks for finally answering the question of how we should all spell caszh
[22/11/2023, 15:55:12] conall: it’s what I’ve settled on
[22/11/2023, 15:55:18] conall: there’s a more correct way to spell it
[22/11/2023, 15:55:34] conall: but it requires going to the wikipedia page for the phonetic alphabet and copying a character
[22/11/2023, 15:55:41] Zoë “cringe” Turner: COOL
[22/11/2023, 15:55:45] Zoë “cringe” Turner: PRESENT BETTER BE GOOD THEN
[22/11/2023, 15:55:59] Zoë “cringe” Turner: obv joking btw this is very sweet

[22/11/2023, 15:56:43] conall: caʒ
[22/11/2023, 15:57:00] Zoë “cringe” Turner: this is very maths
[22/11/2023, 15:57:04] conall: yeah I know
[22/11/2023, 15:57:07] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Maths meets semantics
[22/11/2023, 15:57:17] conall: it doesn’t land, as you can probably tell
[22/11/2023, 15:57:26] conall: HA
[22/11/2023, 15:57:43] conall: omg shut up I’m actually so stressed about it BUT we will not get into that now
[22/11/2023, 15:58:18] conall: Don’t you worry I’ll do that on Saturday
[22/11/2023, 15:58:32] conall: Get incredibly drunk and belligerent, start a fight with Aaron
[22/11/2023, 16:00:57] Zoë “cringe” Turner: why u stressed
[22/11/2023, 16:01:01] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m so easily pleased
[22/11/2023, 16:01:08] conall: hahahahaha
[22/11/2023, 16:01:10] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Someone could give me a melon and I’d be like wow
[22/11/2023, 16:01:22] Zoë “cringe” Turner: So grateful for our connection in this life
[22/11/2023, 16:01:26] conall: I think we’re the same in that regard tbh
[22/11/2023, 16:01:38] conall: BUT it doesn’t work like that when you’re giving the gift
[22/11/2023, 16:01:40] conall: anyway
[22/11/2023, 16:01:52] Zoë “cringe” Turner: He was actually ok last night
[22/11/2023, 16:02:12] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I think he somehow worked out that I wanted him to ask me things so he did
[22/11/2023, 16:02:22] conall: I’ll explain on Sunday and likely give a 40 minute preamble about why it’s so terrible
[22/11/2023, 16:02:25] conall: WOAH
[22/11/2023, 16:02:32] conall: that’s genuinely quite nice

[22/11/2023, 16:03:28] Zoë “cringe” Turner: it’s on the floor
[22/11/2023, 16:03:35] Zoë “cringe” Turner: no I did appreciate it
[22/11/2023, 16:04:22] conall: can’t wait, let’s get this party out of the way
[22/11/2023, 16:04:25] conall: hahahahahah

[22/11/2023, 16:24:25] conall: so we’ll go to the good one
[22/11/2023, 17:49:05] conall: OH and I just remembered what I ALSO meant to ask you. You're not doing anything tonight right? WELL here's something you CAN do
[22/11/2023, 17:49:22] conall: Send me a pic of you from behind, bent over, pleasuring yourself. Unsure of how you're gonna set up the camera for that tbh, but frankly I'm not sure how you managed the first one and you said that was "low effort" so I'll admit my ignorance on these matters
[22/11/2023, 18:02:09] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahahaha. Yeah, I think I can do that. Just checking you know that it won’t be possible to have my jawline in it at the same time?
[22/11/2023, 18:03:09] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Ok 🥰🥰 tbh I think they’re both pretty cheap anyway

[22/11/2023, 18:48:28] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Your Instagram cardboard and this horse head will both be in a corner together all night I imagine
[22/11/2023, 18:53:01] conall: unsure of the ikea reference
[22/11/2023, 18:53:08] conall: instantly
[22/11/2023, 19:38:53] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Something about the meatballs I’m not entirely sure
[22/11/2023, 19:39:03] Zoë “cringe” Turner: But omg
[22/11/2023, 19:39:15] Zoë “cringe” Turner: So I told them both that I signed my contract yesterday
[22/11/2023, 19:39:31] Zoë “cringe” Turner: And Aaron was like YAY and I was like 😒suss
[22/11/2023, 19:39:48] Zoë “cringe” Turner: And just now he’s come in and been like ‘well I need to find somebody to rent my flat!’ Lmao
[22/11/2023, 19:39:54] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Jeez Louise
[22/11/2023, 19:40:43] Zoë “cringe” Turner: now I’m panicking in case something falls through even though I don’t think it can at this point
[22/11/2023, 19:40:45] Zoë “cringe” Turner: But again
[22/11/2023, 19:41:49] Zoë “cringe” Turner: he’s been like ‘I’m handing in my notice on the 1st Dec’ and Hannah has said absolutely nothing to me.. and THEN she went upstairs and he said ‘I know  I’m here a lot but all will become clear, I just need to get some checks done’ and I was like what and he was like oh I can’t say
[22/11/2023, 19:41:57] Zoë “cringe” Turner: as in Hannah doesn’t want me to say
[22/11/2023, 19:42:31] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Why are they being so weird about it !!!!!!
[22/11/2023, 19:46:06] conall: handing in his notice for his job!?
[22/11/2023, 19:46:18] conall: such bad vibes off that whole thing
[22/11/2023, 19:46:32] conall: I’m sorry you have to deal with this BS
[22/11/2023, 19:47:10] Zoë “cringe” Turner: No sorry for his flat
[22/11/2023, 19:48:35] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I feel like I should’ve said well hang on cause I haven’t had the contract sent back to me complete yet etc, but it just feels like a blindside from him, he’s the one telling me, I don’t have anything to do with him, and also if I couldn’t leave when I’m planning to what difference does it make as he’s essentially living here anyway yknow?
[22/11/2023, 19:50:04] conall: oooh I thought he owned it sorry
[22/11/2023, 19:50:23] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Nah
[22/11/2023, 19:50:29] conall: Yeah it’s so lame, also him being like YES is just such a disrespectful thing to do
[22/11/2023, 19:50:41] conall: and WHY hasn’t Hannah talked about any of this with you
[22/11/2023, 19:50:51] conall: it’s so fucked! Sorry I know she’s your mate etc but wtf
[22/11/2023, 19:50:53] Zoë “cringe” Turner: He’ll be getting on this mortgage I assume is the thing he’s just basically told me but not told me
[22/11/2023, 19:51:10] conall: honestly such bad vibes off this
[22/11/2023, 19:51:12] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Nah I think it’s all so odd
[22/11/2023, 19:51:24] conall: he gives me real “get my feet under the table” energy
[22/11/2023, 19:51:25] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Been together 3 months
[22/11/2023, 19:51:46] Zoë “cringe” Turner: yeah exactly
[22/11/2023, 19:51:47] conall: I mean Hannah’s free to do what she wants to do obv, but it is totally fucked imo
[22/11/2023, 19:52:11] conall: get some checks done also
[22/11/2023, 19:52:22] conall: why is he saying this
[22/11/2023, 19:52:34] conall: honestly Hannah’s a total idiot if she lets him on the mortgage
[22/11/2023, 19:53:13] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Just makes me a bit sad
[22/11/2023, 19:53:25] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Anyway I need to shake it off and apply for a JOB
[22/11/2023, 19:53:31] conall: yeah same
[22/11/2023, 19:53:45] conall: Hannah must be quietly just very up for it if this works for her
[22/11/2023, 19:53:48] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’ll email the agency tomorrow and be like yo is it all sorted
[22/11/2023, 19:53:50] conall: some people just get like that
[22/11/2023, 19:54:20] conall: woah! What you applying for
[22/11/2023, 19:54:42] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yeah I think it must just be her vibe but I just don’t like the way she’s handled this transition, just wouldn’t be the way I’d do it really
[22/11/2023, 19:55:05] conall: yeah it’s very very shitty
[22/11/2023, 19:55:15] conall: idk it’s so hard to tell in these situations
[22/11/2023, 19:56:13] conall: ugh sorry
[22/11/2023, 19:56:16] conall: SHAKE IT OFF
[22/11/2023, 19:56:25] conall: (although obv you can still vent if you want to)
[22/11/2023, 19:57:11] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ugh whatever whatever
[22/11/2023, 19:57:17] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’ll just be glad to see the back of it
[22/11/2023, 19:57:32] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Don’t wanna be involved
[22/11/2023, 19:57:40] conall: Yeah
[22/11/2023, 19:57:53] conall: Shame init, it pretty much means you and Hannah won't really stay in contact
[22/11/2023, 19:58:04] conall: Can't imagine you'd want to after how this has gone down
[22/11/2023, 20:18:11] Zoë “cringe” Turner: OH WELL
[22/11/2023, 20:18:18] Zoë “cringe” Turner: buzzing to see u
[22/11/2023, 20:18:25] Zoë “cringe” Turner: And for the whole weekend
[22/11/2023, 20:19:22] Zoë “cringe” Turner: feels apt to have all my pals take over this stupid house for a little while and then to just mic drop and leave ahaha
[22/11/2023, 20:19:35] Zoë “cringe” Turner: the job is a media and communications one
[22/11/2023, 20:26:50] Zoë “cringe” Turner: also just burnt my mouth in the EXACT PLACE YOU BURNT YOURS
[22/11/2023, 20:38:13] conall: I cannot WAIT to see you, I am physically incapable of it
[22/11/2023, 20:38:41] conall: hell yeah. I'll bring my engraver so we can scratch "Fuck Aaron" under the tables and on the toilet seat
[22/11/2023, 20:39:18] conall: quick note, the second sentence was obv a joke. My question is, why did I say hell yeah? Unsure if that's something I say or not tbh
[22/11/2023, 20:39:45] conall: FUN. I would ask for a rundown now but that might be dull for you, if so I will hear about it tomorrow
[22/11/2023, 20:39:50] conall: NOT FUN
[22/11/2023, 21:26:10] Zoë “cringe” Turner: You’re adorable
[22/11/2023, 21:26:21] Zoë “cringe” Turner: hahahahhahaha
[22/11/2023, 21:26:46] Zoë “cringe” Turner: HELL YEAH! 🤣
[22/11/2023, 21:27:36] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It’s not that it’s dull, but I don’t wanna do any fixating on any one job because I think it’s bad juju. But anyway I will tell you tomoz
[22/11/2023, 21:28:04] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’ve got it on my prompt cards for in case we run out of things to say to each other
‎[22/11/2023, 22:19:53] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ‎<attached: 00004426-VIDEO-2023-11-22-22-19-53.mp4>
[22/11/2023, 22:21:01] conall: I was literally about to reply to the above
[22/11/2023, 22:21:14] conall: this thumbnail is frankly more than enough
[22/11/2023, 22:22:23] conall: did not want that to end
[22/11/2023, 22:23:06] conall: distracting me from the very important film that we're watching
[22/11/2023, 22:23:15] conall: (Hard Boiled)
[22/11/2023, 22:24:32] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This was a fear of mine
[22/11/2023, 22:24:38] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Apparently warranted
[22/11/2023, 22:24:51] conall: Can you be here now please
[22/11/2023, 22:25:01] conall: I have important business to discuss with you in person
[22/11/2023, 22:26:22] Zoë “cringe” Turner: What could possibly be SO IMPORTANT that you would drag me from my bed at this hour
[22/11/2023, 22:26:35] Zoë “cringe” Turner: so hot though lmao
[22/11/2023, 22:27:05] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I do wish I was there
[22/11/2023, 22:27:18] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Not watching Hard Boiled
[22/11/2023, 22:32:17] conall: I think that you could do with being taught a lesson, I think you'd agree given the video you've just sent
[22/11/2023, 22:34:08] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Stop it you’re making me very antsy
[22/11/2023, 22:37:58] conall: I don’t know what you’re talking about
[22/11/2023, 22:39:23] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yes, you do
[22/11/2023, 22:40:14] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’ve heard you say enough things into my ear by now that make me feel WEAK to be able to imagine exactly how this would sound
[22/11/2023, 22:42:30] conall: I fail to see how this is my fault
[22/11/2023, 22:43:47] Zoë “cringe” Turner: 😒
[22/11/2023, 22:44:10] conall: I'm not even TRYING to make you antsy. I'm just simply saying that IF you were here, I would have to make sure that you took away some valuable lessons about your body
[22/11/2023, 22:44:18] conall: Just trying to help out jeez
[22/11/2023, 22:47:51] conall: ALSO, there's obviously not much you can say in response to this (other than "thanks" I guess) BUT, literally any time I ask you to take a picture of yourself, you blow me away. Honestly I don't know how you do it, I am obsessed with every aspect of you
[22/11/2023, 22:49:38] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Imagine if you just replied thanks
[22/11/2023, 22:49:41] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I would die
[22/11/2023, 22:50:09] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I want to please you so I do
[22/11/2023, 22:50:19] Zoë “cringe” Turner: You can teach me those lessons tomorrow
[22/11/2023, 22:50:27] conall: ugh
[22/11/2023, 22:50:37] conall: I might need to ask you to stop now tbh
[22/11/2023, 22:51:19] conall: This is gonna be rattling around my brain a lot. Fuck you're so good to me
[22/11/2023, 22:52:51] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I know AND I know
[22/11/2023, 22:52:59] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I will stop
[22/11/2023, 22:53:03] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m gonna sleep
[22/11/2023, 22:53:30] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hope you have enjoyed the film and me being purposefully interruptive
[22/11/2023, 22:53:40] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Xxx 😇
[22/11/2023, 22:55:40] conall: I WAS enjoying the film but it's been heavily overshadowed by your shenanigans
[22/11/2023, 22:56:09] conall: You are incredible
[22/11/2023, 22:57:20] conall: Enjoy your sleep, I look forward to following through on this promise tomorrow
[22/11/2023, 22:57:27] conall: x
[22/11/2023, 22:58:46] Zoë “cringe” Turner: THANKS for making me feel like this
[22/11/2023, 22:59:04] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Soz not soz
[22/11/2023, 23:12:23] conall: You deserve it to feel like this! You ARE incredible Zoë. Tell your mates that I AM completely obsessed with you. You can use this text as proof
[22/11/2023, 23:12:44] conall: Actually no don't do that mega cringe if anyone ever saw this I'd DIE of cringe
[22/11/2023, 23:16:09] conall: You're only making it more likely that tomorrow I won't be able to stop myself from touching you all evening, no matter where we are. This last video has turned me fully into a psycho-incel and it's all your FAULT
[23/11/2023, 07:57:52] Zoë “cringe” Turner: hahahahaha going to show EVERYONE
[23/11/2023, 07:58:05] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Might star that message actually I love it so much
[23/11/2023, 07:58:19] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Though I’m not entirely sure what starring a message does
[23/11/2023, 07:58:59] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Sending this to beam me up softboi out of context
[23/11/2023, 07:59:15] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also morning see you later :)
[23/11/2023, 09:20:15] conall: If I get a WHIFF of you doing that I'm actually going to live in Svalbard
[23/11/2023, 09:20:45] conall: Please do and report back
[23/11/2023, 09:21:12] conall: Unsure what this is. This is what I miss about not really being "online" anymore. This sounds very stupid and funny whatever it is and I'm missing OUT
[23/11/2023, 09:21:26] conall: HEY X
[23/11/2023, 09:31:05] conall: Might put some work into this on my insta algo actually
[23/11/2023, 09:31:56] conall: I find it very distasteful that I just get women in various states of undress. That's not fun content. I want what you've got, however you've got it. It seems way more fun
[23/11/2023, 12:24:14] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Can I come
[23/11/2023, 12:24:42] Zoë “cringe” Turner: OMG will show you later

[23/11/2023, 12:26:22] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It’s exhibition opening day so everyone’s very AHhHHHhHh but I’m quite enjoying it

[23/11/2023, 15:32:31] conall: it’s not my fault I hate women
[23/11/2023, 15:32:35] conall: it’s THEIRS
[23/11/2023, 15:33:24] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ^ this aside because it looks really weird following these messages with this so here’s my caveat message for non existent outside parties

WHERE: 39 Haworth Road, M18 7EN 

HOW: Do not under any circumstances attempt to cross the city from anywhere South via public transport. It won’t work!

[24/11/2023, 22:30:48] conall: I wish I was there to spoon you and hug you tightly (but NOT squeeze you). I am incredibly excited to see you with all of your friends tomorrow, you’re going to be in your element and I’m honestly looking forward to seeing that the most. I’ll be awake for a bit if you want to call, but don’t worry if you just want to get to bed

And yeah sorry all I wanted was spoons and little whispers from you then but I had to do the next best thing and shake myself about/scribble. I feel a bit better now and I’m gonna go to sleep but thank you for saying everything you’ve said and for being here anyways xxx (no irony left in me)
[24/11/2023, 22:45:49] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hope you sleep well 😚😚😚
[24/11/2023, 23:42:06] conall: It’s okay! No need to thank me. I just wish I was there to give you the biggest hug. I was going to write something really effusive here but maybe that’s a bit much
[24/11/2023, 23:42:45] conall: Yeah honestly don’t worry about me at all. I am utterly obsessed with you Zoë and even if you did parr me off saying love you it wouldn’t change a thing
[24/11/2023, 23:43:59] conall: I hope you enjoy your sleep. Thanks for such a nice night last night, I have such a laugh with you every second we’re together. UGH it’s too much how I feel about you it almost hurts.

[27/11/2023, 16:38:00] conall: Need more info on this
[27/11/2023, 16:40:41] conall: BAD tbh Zoë. Ear not good, I feel like I'm on a boat and getting sea-sick, but it'll be fine, tonight is gonna be a very chill night with a bath and all that jazz. When I next get paid I'll be at ZERO debt (besides student loans THANKS tories) so that's a big win right there. ALSO figured out a fun way to be frugal using locked monzo pots which has been a great discovery. Work has been fun too. Big ramble but that's the update
[27/11/2023, 16:40:54] conall: How're you feeling? I got sleepy vibes from you this morning
[27/11/2023, 17:07:01] Zoë “cringe” Turner: lol cause my thought was literally just Roses chocolates
[27/11/2023, 17:07:41] Zoë “cringe” Turner: There was no flood but we were using special tweezers to practice taking frames off the wall so no ART DIES
[27/11/2023, 17:09:51] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Nooo not good :( sounds like you might have an ear infection so drink lots of water and get lots of rest!!!! Tonight sounds like a good plan. And fuck yes zero debt, I feel like that’s happened very quickly from when we first spoke about it??? Love that you have discovered Monzo pots on this day of our Lord November 2023 :p
[27/11/2023, 17:11:07] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I am very sleepy! We were late to bed weren’t we so I haven’t caught up with my usual 11s. I’m gonna bash out this application then also bath/chill/appreciate what a LOVELY weekend I had like a little wet lettuce
[27/11/2023, 17:11:47] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Need to plan the next few weeks really cause moving day is 2 weeks away
[27/11/2023, 17:12:28] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Nearly put a sad face on the whiteboard next to me moving but thought Aaron won’t be sad so didn’t :/

[28/11/2023, 09:51:25] conall: I am GOOD. Woke up at 5am lol. Thinking maybe 7 hours sleep is the most I'm able to manage, not the worst thing in the world but I did call the docs cos I woke up feeling awful. Gonna go see them today! Highly exciting all round
[28/11/2023, 09:51:34] conall: How's the exhibition going? Had any drams?
[28/11/2023, 12:27:16] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I don’t remember talking about moist crisps but we talk about a lot of stuff. Robin told me her grandma used to wipe her ready salted crisps with tissues the other day cause she kept hallucinating from the sodium, funny init
[28/11/2023, 12:27:49] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hm Hm Hm. Have you been to see them yet???? Update when you do please
[28/11/2023, 12:28:34] Zoë “cringe” Turner: 1 x person asking is Jews are allowed in the gallery, 1 x person asking why we’re not being more overtly pro Palestine. YA CAN’T WIN CONALL
[28/11/2023, 13:46:48] conall: hahahahahahahaha that is amazing
[28/11/2023, 13:49:01] conall: I have returned, with NOTHING. Told me to go suck eggs basically after checking my ears and saying I’m inflamed. A bit miffed tbh but I think I just got a bad roll of the doctor dice, next week I’ll be able to be all “LOOK it’s still not solved”
[28/11/2023, 13:50:50] conall: That first question is absolutely wild, why would anyone think that? I feel bad that they’re in a headspace like that
[28/11/2023, 13:51:33] conall: You got any plans for later? I think the answer is no. Plans are “finish application and chill” I think, but I’m worried I got that mixed up with Monday so here’s the question all over again
[28/11/2023, 13:53:23] conall: also just had a pigeon look me right in the eyes then poo on a bin, somethings afoot
[28/11/2023, 15:29:33] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Ugh I hate it when they do this. It COULD just be temporary but yeah you need to keep going back to them if it’s not getting better, they’ll start paying attention then. I always ham up how long it’s been going on for when I go and then they sit up a bit lol
[28/11/2023, 15:29:57] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Maybe make some more delicious soup for ur strength
[28/11/2023, 15:30:46] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Well one of the artists has apparently posted something antisemitic, but I very much doubt it was because that word is just horrendously misused
[28/11/2023, 15:33:20] Zoë “cringe” Turner: NO. I was going to ask Ry if he wanted to chill but I have lots of cardboard boxes I need to get home in an Uber, and I’m not going back out once I’m home. Need to sort some bits out and have found another job at the uni that sounds alright so might just do that. Loving hibernation season x
[28/11/2023, 15:33:26] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Are you finishing your mugs today???
[28/11/2023, 15:33:42] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Suss behaviour this. During a full moon as well
[28/11/2023, 17:36:19] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Thinking about you all the time is literally so embarrassing
[28/11/2023, 18:24:16] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Okay so Hannah is pregnant
[28/11/2023, 18:24:24] Zoë “cringe” Turner: My mum was RIGHT
[28/11/2023, 18:29:07] conall: omg
[28/11/2023, 18:29:26] conall: sorry i was rushing to pottery from climbing, will reply to all of the above asap
[28/11/2023, 18:29:56] conall: we can chat later on the phone if you want? I can imagine you’ve got a lot of thoughts about this news
[28/11/2023, 18:30:11] conall: and also don’t wanna par this, I feel exactly the same but I kinda love it
[28/11/2023, 18:31:18] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It’s okay!
[28/11/2023, 18:31:32] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’ll talk to u about it tomoz cause don’t wanna while they’re in
[28/11/2023, 18:31:46] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m excited for her in a lot of ways
[28/11/2023, 18:31:57] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahahaha

[28/11/2023, 22:20:21] conall: Hope you’re not nervous, you have zero reason to be. Fuck I can’t wait to get this mince pie not-competition out of the way tomorrow. UGH you’re so hot
[28/11/2023, 22:21:44] conall: While I’m on the topic actually (I’ll reply to the vn I just wanted to quickly reply to the pic)

One flashback I DO keep having is you being all “oh Conall I need to show you something upstairs” at your party. It was so unbelievably hot. Thought about that probably one every half hour since Saturday
[28/11/2023, 22:25:37] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I don’t really know why it makes me nervous I think it’s like, I don’t want it to not be what you want???? but ok good excellent
[28/11/2023, 22:27:31] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahahahah omg no idea WHO I thought I was then but very glad it paid off. Fully couldn’t help myself
[28/11/2023, 22:31:45] conall: Okay preface with: OBVIOUSLY I don’t like you being nervous in any way, and I want you to know you have no reason to be. I find any tiny glimpse of you unfathomably hot and that will not change even if you’re hit by a bus.

HOWEVER, you wanting to take the hottest picture that I’ve asked you for really turns me on. The idea that you’re thinking “I hope I did well for him” is causing some incredibly vivid thoughts about what I’m going to do to you tomorrow
[28/11/2023, 22:33:54] conall: I loved how brazen it was. You might as well have asked me to fuck you upstairs tbh. I imagine anyone who overheard wouldn’t have been fooled by your innuendo
[28/11/2023, 22:44:45] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Dying at all of this tbh
[28/11/2023, 22:46:24] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I don’t really remember all of it which makes it almost hotter. Like I know I just started kissing you as soon as the door was closed, but not entirely sure how we got from there to the edge of the bed

[29/11/2023, 10:25:36] conall: https://ottolenghi.co.uk/recipes/gigli-with-chickpeas-and-zaatar-simple
[29/11/2023, 10:25:45] conall: Gonna make this tonight, think I've got pretty much all the stuff in
[29/11/2023, 10:30:43] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This looks amazing
[29/11/2023, 10:30:46] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I love anchovies
[29/11/2023, 10:30:52] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also morning
[29/11/2023, 10:31:06] Zoë “cringe” Turner: !!!!!!!!😎
[29/11/2023, 10:40:13] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Do you have flour/butter/egg for pastry or shall I get these from a shop on route to yours ??? will obv get mince anyway
[29/11/2023, 10:43:02] conall: they’re banging aren’t they. salty little bastards
[29/11/2023, 10:43:35] conall: I don’t! I’m normally in the camp of “cba making pastry, did it like twice and buying it is better”
[29/11/2023, 10:43:57] conall: HOWEVER, if you want to make it then I’ll be happy to. I can get the stuff cos I need to go to the shop anyway
[29/11/2023, 10:44:20] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I refute this
[29/11/2023, 10:44:37] Zoë “cringe” Turner: the pastry is the best bit about making them
[29/11/2023, 10:44:39] Zoë “cringe” Turner: IMO
[29/11/2023, 10:44:42] conall: Interesting
[29/11/2023, 10:45:02] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Cause then it’s all thin and flaky and a bit rubbish but like in a delicious way
[29/11/2023, 10:45:03] conall: I just find that it's a faff, I don't really enjoy making pastry, and buying it is just nicer pastry
[29/11/2023, 10:45:08] conall: but maybe you've got tips
[29/11/2023, 10:45:19] conall: put on a class for me Zoë

[29/11/2023, 10:49:25] Zoë “cringe” Turner: plain flour, 100g butter, a little dairy milk please
[29/11/2023, 10:49:28] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Don’t actually need egg
[29/11/2023, 10:49:41] conall: nah we need that for the wash don't we
[29/11/2023, 10:49:46] conall: gotta wash your mincers
[29/11/2023, 10:49:52] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Can wash with the milk
[29/11/2023, 10:50:05] conall: can't have dirty mincers, I know you're a street urchin but I'm not having it
[29/11/2023, 10:50:11] conall: ofc ofc ofc
[29/11/2023, 10:50:21] conall: as you can tell, baking is not my jam
[29/11/2023, 10:50:55] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Fuming
[29/11/2023, 10:50:59] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Not making them anymore

[29/11/2023, 10:52:40] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Can you get the Robertsons one if they have it
[29/11/2023, 10:52:59] conall: didn't realise I was dealing with such a mince pie FANATIC
[29/11/2023, 10:53:06] Zoë “cringe” Turner: hahahahahhaa
[29/11/2023, 10:53:26] conall: but yes I will
[29/11/2023, 10:53:34] Zoë “cringe” Turner: We are gonna have to hand cut too I suppose
[29/11/2023, 10:53:36] Zoë “cringe” Turner: That’s funny
[29/11/2023, 10:53:56] conall: Kate's got cookie cutters for pottery
[29/11/2023, 10:54:09] conall: one of them will probably work well enough
[29/11/2023, 10:54:15] conall: if I'm getting a tray, what we saying
[29/11/2023, 10:54:18] conall: shallow or deep
[29/11/2023, 10:54:36] Zoë “cringe” Turner: shallow
[29/11/2023, 10:54:39] conall: I like both. Shallow is higher pastry ratio which I quite like
[29/11/2023, 10:54:47] conall: but deep you get all the MEAT
[29/11/2023, 10:54:55] conall: kk
[29/11/2023, 10:54:59] Zoë “cringe” Turner: shallow you can eat more of them

[04/12/2023, 09:58:54] Zoë “cringe” Turner: unsure how hard I’ll throw myself into staff do
[04/12/2023, 09:59:04] conall: I bet it’ll be great
[04/12/2023, 09:59:05] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Could you be arsed? Yes

[04/12/2023, 10:01:37] conall: I do but much better than staring at my weird ceiling alone
[04/12/2023, 10:01:52] Zoë “cringe” Turner: But after Monday can you chill more ???
[04/12/2023, 10:01:59] conall: hmmmm unsure

[04/12/2023, 10:02:27] conall: next two weekends after this are blackpoolones
[04/12/2023, 10:02:29] Zoë “cringe” Turner: That ceiling is gonna see so many things when your bedroom becomes party room
[04/12/2023, 10:02:52] conall: i’m still opposed to this
[04/12/2023, 10:03:11] conall: anyway we can discuss when you’re back
[04/12/2023, 10:03:24] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahahaha
[04/12/2023, 10:03:32] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m gonna get up now cause I can hear Ava being hungover
[04/12/2023, 10:03:33] conall: not to be a big keeno but i’d like to get a few things BOOKED in with you
[04/12/2023, 10:03:36] Zoë “cringe” Turner: And eggs
[04/12/2023, 10:03:46] conall: too busy to be fly by night
[04/12/2023, 10:03:47] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Woah keen!
[04/12/2023, 10:03:54] conall: i know ick or what
[04/12/2023, 10:04:05] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I leave you with this full length image of the scarf
[04/12/2023, 10:04:15] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Because the one of it round my neck was insufficient
[04/12/2023, 10:04:33] conall: wrong
‎[04/12/2023, 10:04:34] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ‎<attached: 00005650-PHOTO-2023-12-04-10-04-34.jpg>
[04/12/2023, 10:04:41] conall: didn’t care about the scarf really
[04/12/2023, 10:04:46] conall: just wanted a pic of you
[04/12/2023, 10:04:48] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I care about the scarf
[04/12/2023, 10:04:48] conall: hehe
[04/12/2023, 10:04:54] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m hurt that you’d say that
[04/12/2023, 10:05:52] conall: it is a good scarf but I don’t find it as alluring as you soz
[04/12/2023, 10:06:10] conall: love this skirt also
[04/12/2023, 10:06:15] conall: have a good day!!
[04/12/2023, 10:07:25] Zoë “cringe” Turner: 😮😜🫶
[04/12/2023, 10:07:35] Zoë “cringe” Turner: BYE you have a good day too xxxxxx
[04/12/2023, 10:08:32] Zoë “cringe” Turner: think we’re just gonna try and do free museums and then have tea with Nick later (Dutch bf)
[04/12/2023, 10:35:23] conall: Ace! I remember a mouse one that was very silly but who knows if it’s still open, there was a good one in this mega art-deco-y building too but I can’t remember the name. Not very useful and REGARDLESS Ava has better recommendations I have no doubt. LOVE a city break they’re the best especially when you’ve got someone who lives there 

Miss (cringe) you (cringe) lmao (saying lmao to give distance and an air of coolness to my emotions) x
[04/12/2023, 11:23:31] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I CANT come back from Amsterdam and tell people I went to the Cat and the Mouse museum though can I
[04/12/2023, 11:23:37] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’d sound like a fucking weirdo
[04/12/2023, 11:27:27] Zoë “cringe” Turner: We’re going to the Stedelijk cause there’s a big Nan Goldin exhibition on which I’m VERY excited about cause I had no idea. That gallery looks like a big bath, don’t know if you remember it????
[04/12/2023, 11:28:06] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Lmaooooo you’re adorable miss you too can’t wait to see you
[04/12/2023, 11:28:12] Zoë “cringe” Turner: TOMORROW !
[04/12/2023, 13:35:58] conall: I personally think this would be hilarious but if you wanna be BORING and go see an actually good art gallery then more fool you
[04/12/2023, 13:37:36] conall: I do know this one I think? It’s like an upside down triangle? I had no idea who Big Nan Goldin was but I googled her and found out that I both enjoy her work and she’s in fact not called “Big Nan Goldin”

Hard swings from that search I tell you
[04/12/2023, 13:38:34] conall: haha lol can’t wait to see you either lol I’m cool ha ha
[04/12/2023, 17:09:48] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It is a bit like an upside triangle and it has that very yellow escalator inside. The photos were actually pretty HEAVY mostly and I’m feeling very dead from lack of sleep rn hehe
[04/12/2023, 17:10:13] Zoë “cringe” Turner: wanna be in bed with you !!!!!
[04/12/2023, 17:10:19] Zoë “cringe” Turner: how’s your day been??
[04/12/2023, 18:44:24] conall: yes!! Yellow escalator bring it all back. I saw some really shit exhibition their which I really wanted to like but couldn’t get into it. HATE when that happens. Was it good though, despite being heavy?
[04/12/2023, 18:45:32] conall: I would love this right now, my bed smells of you still and it is doing things to my brain that I didn’t expect. Wholesome and not wholesome in equal measure. STOP BEING SO ALLURING GOD
[04/12/2023, 18:46:47] conall: It’s been good! Work is crap atm but I’ve chatted to my Grandma and Dad, did some boring life admin and eaten tons of fruit. Was gonna go out tonight but I just cba so me and Goob are gonna watch a film / chat for a few hours. Where you off for tea?
[04/12/2023, 19:44:19] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Couldn’t find a way in eh?? Classic stuff. Yes it was good I enjoyed it!!! There was a photo of a man sucking his own cock in one of the slideshows lol, we gasped
‎[04/12/2023, 19:45:34] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ‎<attached: 00005678-PHOTO-2023-12-04-19-45-34.jpg>
[04/12/2023, 19:50:01] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m really not sure how you’re preserving this in your bed but maybe I just STINK of myself. I’ll be back soon to top it up though / to talk about whatever unwholesome thoughts you’re thinking of
[04/12/2023, 19:50:23] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Feel free to elaborate now if you like
[04/12/2023, 19:56:44] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Oh really?? Is it because they’re asking you to do that stuff you don’t wanna do?? That other stuff sounds lovely though! LOVE FRUIT I am eating loads of Dutch blueberries right now. We’re just at Nick’s, he made curry and we’re watching an awful Christmas film. I hope your film is better than this one. It has the American pie man in it that nobody cares about anymore
[04/12/2023, 21:00:29] conall: I could NOT find a way in, what a GREAT way to put that I'm happy to be hearing this for the first time ever. That must be a very flexible man, I don't think I could stretch that far and I've done pilates at least 5 times
[04/12/2023, 21:01:13] conall: You are always telling me things about my arms. It's mostly the veins in them, at least that's what I remember
[04/12/2023, 21:01:41] conall: I think it's because I didn't sleep in it for a few days after you last did, also it's mostly perfume smell so it hangs about but I LOVE it
[04/12/2023, 21:02:31] conall: Currently thinking about how you squeeze my head between your thighs when you orgasm on my tongue, and the way you wet your fingers and then make me taste them - it sends me completely ferrel. The way you kiss down my stomach as you start to go down on me, the way you move in bed when you're just enjoying feeling sexy, how excited you are to send incredible photos of yourself to me. There's a lot of other stuff floating around there, I'll stop because even writing this is sending me a bit and I can't do anything about it for at least a couple of hours
[04/12/2023, 21:02:51] conall: OH actually, one last thing. You got so wet when literally all I was doing to you was whispering into your ear. Makes me feel like a hilariously sexy human being. I hope I make you feel even 10% as sexy as I think you are
[04/12/2023, 21:03:13] conall: This sounds like a divine evening tbh. What film you watching??
[04/12/2023, 21:03:29] conall: We've sacked off the film and we're just watching the X Files pilot for some silly reason
‎[04/12/2023, 22:03:41] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ‎<attached: 00005689-AUDIO-2023-12-04-22-03-41.opus>
[04/12/2023, 22:10:02] Zoë “cringe” Turner: P.s. you are a hilariously sexy human being. You are the most gorgeous human being I’ve ever laid my little gremlin fingers on. I’m glad you feel like this around me, the feeling is mutual, we obviously have a vibe I think. Do you think we have a vibe???? There’s definitely something going on here anyway
[04/12/2023, 23:05:18] conall: Hahahah, I was hamming it up. I was going to say “I couldn’t find a way in” initially but can’t remember why I didn’t. Unsure why that phrase stuck with me but I like it
[04/12/2023, 23:05:30] conall: Enjoy your day tomorrow! Let me know where you end up going for grub, I’m well jealous of your trip there I proper miss that place. Not as much as I miss YOU though
[04/12/2023, 23:06:05] conall: You DO make me feel incredibly sexy. I’m genuinely not used to feeling this attractive and it is weirdly taking some getting used to so thanks for you being patient about it. Which reminds me I cannot get enough of catching you ogling me. I need to watch out for this more cos it makes me totally understand why you enjoy me looking at you in the way I do

and yes vibes in full effect
[04/12/2023, 23:06:15] conall: UGH I need to see you. I am going to eat you alive
[04/12/2023, 23:06:25] conall: x
[05/12/2023, 09:16:11] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I just made myself come twice thinking about your body and the noises you make
[05/12/2023, 09:16:19] Zoë “cringe” Turner: 😩
[05/12/2023, 09:16:27] Zoë “cringe” Turner: sorry I couldn’t wait
[05/12/2023, 09:28:41] conall: love it when you tell me these things
[05/12/2023, 09:30:18] conall: Don't apologise I've already come once today thinking about you, I can't WAIT to see you. I'm going to find it very difficult not to immediately tear your clothes off
[05/12/2023, 10:14:57] conall: oh also I've read this about 100 times since you sent it and just wanted to say thanks, very cute message and you're great
[05/12/2023, 10:15:36] conall: ALSO I forgot to say there's a museum inside the airport if you arrive early and haven't got anything else to do
[05/12/2023, 10:26:39] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Nobody will be stopping you don’t worry
[05/12/2023, 10:29:10] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It’s just TRUE. But you’re very welcome. Also you don’t have to thank me for being patient with you, I’m super happy you can start to see what I see. It is hard not to when somebody is looking at you like that isn’t it hahaha
[05/12/2023, 10:31:27] Zoë “cringe” Turner: IS THERE? God it’s such a strange huge place in there. I’m currently waiting for Turkish eggs in a place Ava and Ed recommended, took ages getting up for reasons (sleep & horny reasons, my two personality traits), hoping I won’t be too late over there but the two hours beforehand is just a safety period isn’t it really
[05/12/2023, 10:31:38] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Then again I love THE RULES !!!!
[05/12/2023, 10:31:50] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hope you’re having a nice morning 🫶
[05/12/2023, 12:11:28] conall: If you could arrive in as few items as possible that would be very helpful
[05/12/2023, 12:12:00] conall: Love all of this. Love you a lot it's not even funny
[05/12/2023, 12:12:56] conall: There's a library too! Lots to keep you entertained. It's honestly my favourite airport (as SAD as it is to have a favourite airport). Let me know how you're getting on
[05/12/2023, 12:13:53] conall: I am thank you! In such a good mood today. So much fun stuff going on atm it's hard not to be proper chuffed at all times
[05/12/2023, 13:15:21] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Excuse me it is cold haven’t you noticed
[05/12/2023, 13:16:12] Zoë “cringe” Turner: 😘😘😘😘😘😘
[05/12/2023, 13:18:07] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahahaha I love this. I’m not the most chilled out person at the airport so I can’t usually fit exploring in, but this is a very you thing to say
[05/12/2023, 13:18:29] Zoë “cringe” Turner: YAY
[05/12/2023, 13:38:27] Zoë “cringe” Turner: On the plane now! Should land at 3.15
[05/12/2023, 13:46:55] conall: woooooo
[05/12/2023, 13:47:05] conall: Have a safe flight
[05/12/2023, 13:47:31] conall: Not sure how that’s my problem
[05/12/2023, 13:47:49] conall: Hahahahahaha shut up. I want to know what you got up to but you can tell me later
[05/12/2023, 13:48:00] conall: SEE YOU SOON XXXX

[07/12/2023, 20:43:05] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Interested to know if you do think I’m an organised person or not
[07/12/2023, 20:44:29] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I think I’m organised but I DONT think I like packing because it’s so awkward and you have to visualise the unvisualisable for a string of days
[07/12/2023, 20:44:39] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hope you’re having fun with my new best friend et al

[08/12/2023, 07:28:46] conall: me rn
[08/12/2023, 08:10:54] conall: Thoughts on my mind this morning:
- This prawn sandwich is nice 
- What’s Jason up to? What’s his morning routine? Does Vicky roll her eyes when she wakes up?
- ⁠I am tired
- ⁠Loved the phone call yesterday and could’ve chatted for another 3 hours. Honestly it’s cringe how much I enjoy talking to you. I wanted to go home early for the train but just wandered the streets for an hour and a half
- ⁠Can’t find any more QUALITY memes to send because the signal is so bad on this train. Also I would be worried that someone would see my phone screen and think I actually find these memes funny
- ⁠Uber driver was great this morning, he was trying to get me to convert to islam but drove very quickly
- ⁠Looking at every woman and thinking “lol bet you kiss your mates when you’re drunk, silly women”
[08/12/2023, 10:01:47] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahahahhaha
[08/12/2023, 10:02:26] Zoë “cringe” Turner: hello has your sleepy head arrived ??????? Does the air smell different down there???? Did you get a train nap ?????
[08/12/2023, 10:03:37] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Funny because I also got a prawn sandwich at early in the morning when I went to Amsterdam and thought, this is a weird thing to have at 10am. BUT it was actually a crayfish sandwich because I was in Pret. And it was delicious. Prawns/crayfish are good at all times
[08/12/2023, 10:04:08] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Jason is a morning person - as you could have probably intuited
[08/12/2023, 10:04:25] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Wonder if he would eat a prawn sandwich at 8 o clock
[08/12/2023, 10:05:24] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Love the idea that if uber man had been driving any slower, that might’ve been you converted
[08/12/2023, 10:05:42] Zoë “cringe” Turner: They do really put their foot on it when you have a train to catch I’ve noticed
[08/12/2023, 10:06:38] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Please don’t send me any more memes
[08/12/2023, 10:06:54] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I love you as you are. Meme less

[09/12/2023, 10:09:30] conall: Hmmmm
[09/12/2023, 10:09:36] conall: 7 hours?
[09/12/2023, 10:09:42] conall: not bad not bad
[09/12/2023, 10:09:49] conall: still in bed now
[09/12/2023, 10:09:56] conall: thinking unwholesome thoughts mostly
[09/12/2023, 10:10:25] conall: also how cringe is this
[09/12/2023, 10:10:36] conall: now when i’m sleeping / going to sleep
[09/12/2023, 10:11:10] conall: i’m like “no have a good sleep, you should care about this. Zoë cares about it a lot and SHE sleeps really well”
[09/12/2023, 10:11:54] conall: realised I’m bad at the whole wind down thing, I get myself all hyped up at silly things and distracted from the GOAL of sleeping
[09/12/2023, 10:16:10] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This is unlike you!
[09/12/2023, 10:16:28] Zoë “cringe” Turner: awwwww Conall hahaha
[09/12/2023, 10:16:32] Zoë “cringe” Turner: we sleep different though
[09/12/2023, 10:17:10] Zoë “cringe” Turner: What you getting hyped up about at sleep time
[09/12/2023, 10:17:16] Zoë “cringe” Turner: tell me
[09/12/2023, 10:17:23] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I used to really struggle getting to sleep
[09/12/2023, 10:17:39] Zoë “cringe” Turner: until I was 25 then something just switched off
[09/12/2023, 10:17:45] conall: it ACTUALLY is somewhat tbh
[09/12/2023, 10:18:10] conall: I just do all the bad things as I’m getting off to sleep
[09/12/2023, 10:18:33] conall: googling stuff, getting excited about projects, texting people, blah blah
[09/12/2023, 10:18:41] conall: makes me all excitable
[09/12/2023, 10:19:37] Zoë “cringe” Turner: hahaha what no it isn’t
[09/12/2023, 10:19:52] Zoë “cringe” Turner: hmmm maybe you’re not getting that time in the day then
[09/12/2023, 10:20:03] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Like dedicated think time
[09/12/2023, 10:20:10] conall: oh no I am
[09/12/2023, 10:20:20] conall: just hard to turn the brain off
[09/12/2023, 10:20:37] conall: conversely in the morning the brain starts going OH YEAH DO THIS
[09/12/2023, 10:20:42] conall: and hard to turn it off also
[09/12/2023, 10:21:27] conall: probs just need to build better habits, as opposed to saying “oh I just can’t sleep”. My sinuses are a bit fucked still but if I wake up at 5 I should just get a drink and go back to sleep
[09/12/2023, 10:21:33] conall: like ZOË DOES
[09/12/2023, 10:22:44] conall: I think this is one of those self perception vs you perception things
[09/12/2023, 10:25:40] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Well yeah but this might not be as easy for you idk, you told me you did that a few times recently I think but maybe you need to keep up the practice
[09/12/2023, 10:26:10] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I would also like to turn off better when I’m with you for sleeps so we could try things
[09/12/2023, 10:26:34] Zoë “cringe” Turner: You are literally always telling me about all your unwholesome thoughts !!!!!!
[09/12/2023, 10:26:39] Zoë “cringe” Turner: And I love them
[09/12/2023, 10:29:45] conall: yeah same
[09/12/2023, 10:29:58] conall: I’m just quite bad at it because I get really excitable really easily
[09/12/2023, 10:35:19] conall: hahahahaha shut up you’re always doing it!
[09/12/2023, 10:35:30] conall: i’m merely responding
[09/12/2023, 10:36:11] Zoë “cringe” Turner: are you actually gaslighting me right now
[09/12/2023, 10:36:34] conall: actually NOT

[09/12/2023, 10:40:37] conall: hehe
[09/12/2023, 10:40:53] conall: this is uber cringe
[09/12/2023, 10:41:22] conall: but generally I don’t actually do this much horny texting, obv done it a bit before but not really to this degree
‎[09/12/2023, 10:42:29] conall: ‎<attached: 00006421-AUDIO-2023-12-09-10-42-29.opus>
[09/12/2023, 10:44:12] Zoë “cringe” Turner: hahahahaha WHY HAS THIS BECOME A FIGHT
[09/12/2023, 10:44:24] conall: GOD I HATE YOU
[09/12/2023, 10:44:45] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I just thought you were genuinely trying to tell me that you never have horny thoughts in the morning / any time / ever about ME
[09/12/2023, 10:44:58] Zoë “cringe” Turner: And I was like well no that’s not true
[09/12/2023, 10:44:58] conall: omg could you imagine
[09/12/2023, 10:45:07] conall: no I meant “normally”
[09/12/2023, 10:45:14] conall: I am currently in a state of exception
[09/12/2023, 10:45:25] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yeah ok I get it now
[09/12/2023, 10:45:37] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Thanks for clarifying
[09/12/2023, 10:46:06] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Maybe this is just you now though
[09/12/2023, 10:46:13] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ‘The new normal’
[09/12/2023, 10:46:20] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Lol cringe remember covid

[09/12/2023, 10:48:09] conall: actually worst response
[09/12/2023, 10:48:11] Zoë “cringe” Turner: HEHE
[09/12/2023, 10:48:15] conall: could you imagine responding like that
[09/12/2023, 10:48:24] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I AM SOOOO JOKING
[09/12/2023, 10:48:29] conall: hehe I know
[09/12/2023, 10:49:23] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I find you embarrassingly attractive, to the point where I’ve been considering looking into the neuroscience of attraction
[09/12/2023, 10:49:34] conall: HA
[09/12/2023, 10:49:36] Zoë “cringe” Turner: just haven’t had the time yet

[09/12/2023, 10:49:50] Zoë “cringe” Turner: like where is this coming from
[09/12/2023, 10:49:58] conall: I was worried for a bit that you might look like me and that’s why I like your face so much
[09/12/2023, 10:50:01] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hey google
[09/12/2023, 10:50:14] conall: but then I googled it and apparently that’s not true and also you don’t look like me
[09/12/2023, 10:50:15] Zoë “cringe” Turner: What is this man doing to me etc etc
[09/12/2023, 10:50:24] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahahahhahahaha
[09/12/2023, 10:50:45] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I thought that was a bit true
[09/12/2023, 10:50:51] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Like features ??
[09/12/2023, 10:51:43] conall: it is to some degree but only in quite a broad sense
[09/12/2023, 10:52:10] conall: at least this is what my cursory google from weeks ago tells me
[09/12/2023, 10:52:27] conall: love this
[09/12/2023, 10:54:05] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Ok
[09/12/2023, 10:54:12] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Maybe we look like each others tribe
[09/12/2023, 10:54:14] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Or something
[09/12/2023, 10:54:31] conall: who knows
[09/12/2023, 10:55:05] conall: tbh I look at you and wonder how not literally every person alive thinks you’re insanely gorgeous but then I realise that there are a lot of IDIOTS out there
[09/12/2023, 11:09:34] Zoë “cringe” Turner: hey how do you know not every person alive thinks this :(
[09/12/2023, 11:10:21] Zoë “cringe” Turner: lol no I think the same about you though

[09/12/2023, 11:24:02] conall: fair point tbh
[09/12/2023, 11:24:19] conall: maybe they do and they’re not telling me

[11/12/2023, 22:49:03] conall: Glad that I could make it a bit easier for you, although as I said before shoving stuff in the van is the easiest bit!

[12/12/2023, 13:22:31] conall: Pretty good! Still a bit tired and rough cos I slept awfully last night but that’s fine. Dropped the van off and then had a PRODUCTIVE day at work so I’m feeling like an actual member of society again

If it works out you can finish work earlyish and she’s free quickly we could maybe fit it in but it’s a bit up in the air anyway so she’s said not to worry

[13/12/2023, 20:45:00] conall: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[14/12/2023, 12:44:12] conall: Hope you’re feeling okay about everything, come Sunday you’ll hopefully be in a spot where you’ve got a nice room and this interview will be out of the way. Sorry if I was a bit “let’s talk about this” earlier, I am a bit like that and sometimes it’s not very helpful. Whatever it was, I hope you’re okay. Good luck with prep today, I’ll see you soon x
[14/12/2023, 16:58:09] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hellooo. I don’t feel fantastic today but I’ll be better this time tomorrow. I’m sorry about earlier, I just feel down generally and a few things triggered some monkey brain stuff and now I feel like I let you down and so on and so on. I’m also PMSing which isn’t helpful in these situations! I can explain a bit better when we’re both feeling good. Hope you are ok xx
[14/12/2023, 19:32:26] conall: Hiya, yeah I’ve been replaying a lot of the morning over in my head and spotted a thing that I said that I think (I don’t know obv) that really didn’t come out like I wanted it to and might have been a bit hurtful. No need to go through it now as you say, but it’s possible you might know what I mean, so I’m sorry regardless.

Don’t feel like you’ve let me down at all!! We had a bit of a chat, you were as open as you wanted to be about what you were thinking, which is all I ask for in these situations. Honestly don’t layer on extra stuff, we’re totally GREAT so don’t add that to the pile.

Focus on you for the time being, I’m honestly doing fine. I’ve got a chill evening ahead of me, gonna chat to Goob and Seymour for a bit. I hope you’re doing okay x

[15/12/2023, 13:41:22] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Can you tell me a fact
[15/12/2023, 14:04:01] conall: - train wheels are cone shaped, not cylindrical 
- ⁠blackpool illuminations started in the 1800’s, BEFORE Edison filed for a patent for his light bulb
- ⁠https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_(goose)
[15/12/2023, 14:04:28] conall: these are just what came to me at this moment, I think of Andy the goose probably once a week
[15/12/2023, 14:06:07] conall: oh another one
[15/12/2023, 14:06:38] conall: the 9th largest pyramid in the world is just some fishing shop in america
[15/12/2023, 14:06:59] conall: that is all for now but I’ll send any through that bubble up from my subconscious
‎[15/12/2023, 14:09:41] conall: ‎<attached: 00007115-PHOTO-2023-12-15-14-09-41.jpg>
[15/12/2023, 14:09:41] conall: fletch sent me this, not really a fact but it will make your brain respond in a decidedly “not bored” way
[15/12/2023, 14:10:43] conall: another fact that I learned in Bleinhem Palace, organists wear pointy shoes so they can touch the thin pedals properly. They often get sores on their feet because the shoes are tight
[15/12/2023, 14:11:09] conall: I’ll stop now, you’ve had enough to keep you going for a bit I think
[15/12/2023, 14:11:19] conall: tell me your favourite fact out of this list, and why
[15/12/2023, 14:13:05] conall: I have thought of another fact but it concerns an underwater welding disaster so I don’t think it’s up your alley tbh
‎[15/12/2023, 14:19:23] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ‎<attached: 00007121-PHOTO-2023-12-15-14-19-23.jpg>
[15/12/2023, 14:19:29] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Bit much
[15/12/2023, 14:19:46] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Do you think they were jealous of the Nike deal
[15/12/2023, 14:20:10] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also desperate to understand the psychology of the little girl naming the goose after a girl she had a fight with
[15/12/2023, 14:20:21] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Did she wish the girl disabled
[15/12/2023, 14:20:25] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Did she have a crush on the girl
[15/12/2023, 14:20:29] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It’s one or the other
[15/12/2023, 14:20:54] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This looks very cold
[15/12/2023, 14:22:39] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This is my favourite until the bit about sores
[15/12/2023, 14:23:42] conall: this was I LOVE about this wikipedia page
[15/12/2023, 14:23:48] conall: I have asked all of these questions
[15/12/2023, 14:24:03] conall: there’s so much depth to the Andy story
[15/12/2023, 14:24:06] conall: so much we don’t know
[15/12/2023, 14:24:15] conall: so what’s your favourite given the sores
[15/12/2023, 14:24:19] conall: it’s gotta be Andy

[15/12/2023, 14:25:48] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yes fine it’s Andy
[15/12/2023, 14:25:53] Zoë “cringe” Turner: The train wheels are too confusing
[15/12/2023, 14:26:06] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I want an Andy Netflix 3 part limited series

[15/12/2023, 14:27:00] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Ugh god here he is
[15/12/2023, 14:27:02] conall: he’d put a load of burial tunes in there and we’d all go home thinking we are Andy

[26/12/2023, 08:49:31] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hiya
[26/12/2023, 08:51:10] conall: Morning babes, obviously CRINGE to send this message in the morning HOWEVER you are just on my mind all the time. I hope you’re doing okay what with all the faint lines and inexplainable family dynamics. Looking forward to seeing you very soon. I just wanna give you a big hug and squeeze just hard enough that you think I’m gonna do that annoying squeezing thing that hurts you but I won’t and it’ll just be cosy instead. It’s utterly cringe how much I miss you but it’s likely because you feel like such a part of my life and Christmas is that sort of time where you just wanna be with people you love

ANYWAY not sure why I’m such a wet flannel this morning. I will call you some names to balance this out.

[26/12/2023, 09:09:15] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also missing you in bed with me so much like I honestly just want my face in your armpit hahahaha
[26/12/2023, 09:21:24] conall: my armpits do stink (but not too much)
[26/12/2023, 09:22:36] conall: Yeah that’s what I came to realise this morning, it’s fine. I think it’s just how things have fallen this year also. Bummer to not hang with people but everyone has lives so you just have to do what you can. Next year I’ll be a bit more proactive and it’ll be fine
[26/12/2023, 09:23:32] conall: VERY glad. One of my favourite things in the world are when you send wet morning texts like that so I assumed you would enjoy it

[26/12/2023, 18:11:02] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yeah sounds good, just try and sneak off by yourself for a bit if you can eh xx
‎[26/12/2023, 18:11:36] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ‎<attached: 00008314-PHOTO-2023-12-26-18-11-36.jpg>
[26/12/2023, 18:17:54] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Sorry if I wasn’t saying the right thing earlier or seemed a bit in my own head, I guess I am at the mo, and also trying to work out what you need ??? so I can give it to u
[26/12/2023, 18:36:01] conall: WOAH!!
[26/12/2023, 18:36:13] conall: This is amazing!!!
[26/12/2023, 18:36:18] conall: nah you weren’t at all
[26/12/2023, 18:36:47] conall: I’m bad at those convos because I vent then feel bad for venting because I don’t like dissing my family and I don’t like feeling like I’m using you as a therapist
[26/12/2023, 18:37:16] conall: I know that’s not what I was doing it was just normal venting I just have a low threshold for me in that regard
[26/12/2023, 18:37:24] conall: ANYWAY
[26/12/2023, 18:37:28] conall: you were great honestly
[26/12/2023, 18:37:44] conall: you said all the right stuff, I didn’t come away thinking you were in your own head at all
[26/12/2023, 18:37:59] conall: I’m really glad you’ve got some goals sorted and I TOO have some goals now
[26/12/2023, 18:38:29] conall: well I did before but refreshed ones heheh YOU’RE involved in one of them but obv not gonna tell you 😝
[26/12/2023, 18:39:42] conall: and lastly
[26/12/2023, 18:42:02] conall: I don’t need anything from you!! Besides you just being you. I genuinely feel fine now. I think I just put too much pressure on this time of year and it’s very silly of me to do. I hope you’re feeling okay in yourself. I think I feel bad about that call because you’re going through it at home too and I monopolised the convo a bit. I’m sorry about that
[26/12/2023, 18:47:29] conall: also I tried to find the life being a garden thing but couldn’t come across where it was initially from
[26/12/2023, 18:48:40] conall: also I love you. You’re so kind and giving but genuinely that conversation we had was lovely and my only issue with it was that I rambled on about myself so much. Don’t worry about a thing babes xx
[26/12/2023, 19:06:34] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yeah you know this already really but you don’t need to feel bad about it, you clearly just needed that space and if I felt like I wanted to talk about my stuff I would’ve also made that clear but I’m actually fine and don’t have much to vent about that I won’t tell you when I see you. I feel like you’ve just got a really full head and I’m very happy to be inside it for a bit!! I think I find it a bit confusing when I’m saying things that might help but then I can tell you don’t really want them because you’re feeling like you’re talking about it too much so then I’m like OKAY but then I feel bad for not being able to sort it but sometimes u just gotta sort it yourself I know!! BIG RAMBLE but anyway you can talk to me about anything when you want, that is partly what I am here for and I love you a lot :) xxx
[26/12/2023, 19:06:55] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m glad you’re feeling better AND that you’ve written new goals AND that I’m in them hehehe
[26/12/2023, 19:07:22] conall: aw sorry
[26/12/2023, 19:07:30] conall: did I park you off somehow?
[26/12/2023, 19:07:43] conall: par*
[26/12/2023, 19:07:58] conall: i don’t mean it in a “omg i need to apologise how bad of me way”
[26/12/2023, 19:08:12] conall: just would like to understand where your headspace is
[26/12/2023, 19:08:46] Zoë “cringe” Turner: No not really it was more like you tried to cut it off at points but you obv still needed to talk about it
[26/12/2023, 19:09:02] Zoë “cringe” Turner: But I think I knew why you were doing that
[26/12/2023, 19:10:04] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I can see you recording but I’m gonna go eat some tea lol brb

[26/12/2023, 21:31:25] Zoë “cringe” Turner: no this is good because this is how I felt when you were asking me about presents and I thought you meant for me

[31/12/2023, 17:40:55] Zoë “cringe” Turner: 🙄
[31/12/2023, 17:45:20] conall: oh also
[31/12/2023, 17:45:30] conall: I did say this in person but I want to STRESS it
[31/12/2023, 17:47:34] conall: Thank you for being so open with me about what you need from this, and what you need me to do in response to you. It can seem like little things, but they all add up to either being a partner who gives a shit or a partner who doesn’t. I know it’s hard to vocalise these things, especially when you’re stressed about sleeping and everything. I’m sorry I took a bit of time to respond to it when you said it, I’ll try to shorten that time in future so you’re not feeling like I’m sulking.

ANYWAY, that’s all. Just wanted to say thanks. Really appreciate you etc cringe etc lmao cringe love you blah blah cringe
[31/12/2023, 17:58:02] Zoë “cringe” Turner: lol blah blah cringe is it
[31/12/2023, 18:02:35] Zoë “cringe” Turner: No thank you for listening and responding like you did - I think I do fumble around with these things at first because I spent years not vocalising things and then when I started to it wasn’t ever met well and whatever, so sometimes don’t articulate it super well. But we got there and basically I just wanted to explain that I like being able to be still and quiet with someone without ever wanting to shut you down because I love the way you are, and I know we can be those things because we have been, I just sometimes need reassurance of that when I ask for it, and I know that comes more with time too
[31/12/2023, 18:03:54] Zoë “cringe” Turner: And thanks for reiterating that I have a part in that too and that it’s helpful for me to say when I need those things
[31/12/2023, 18:05:20] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m gonna get ready and stuff now but lmk if that all makes sense or if you want to talk about it more another time
[31/12/2023, 18:08:41] conall: Nah that all makes sense babes. People are MESSY so it’s fine you didn’t get it out in the perfect way the first time, I got what you meant eventually after I let the monkey brain responses calm down a bit. I do love being still and quiet with you, and tbh I WANT to get better at doing that so this is all working out swimmingly. They’re all very subtle changes these but this is what getting know each other is really all about. A very exciting stage if you ask me. I love getting a glimpse into your brain
[31/12/2023, 18:10:05] conall: Anyway there are more things I’d like to talk about with regards to the convo, it’s possible they were just things you threw out there because you were stressed, but they also might have some significance to them so I’d like to talk about them in future at some point. They’re not big issues by any stretch I just wanna make sure I’ve understood you fully
[31/12/2023, 18:10:56] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Love all this
[31/12/2023, 18:11:16] conall: Have a blast of a night tonight, I’ve just finished course ONE of my dinner tonight. I’m onto course two then I’ve got a cheesecake slice to eat, a notebook to write in and a bath to run
[31/12/2023, 18:11:57] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yeah I think it’s probs a good idea to have it again when it’s not 1am and we’re both stressing
[31/12/2023, 18:12:33] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This is so indulgent I’m obsessed
[31/12/2023, 18:12:51] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I will have a blast thank you I hope you do too !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

[05/01/2024, 13:31:01] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Water bottle pls xx
[05/01/2024, 20:42:45] conall: Hey, I’m gonna get an early night, I had a bath and it’s turned me to mush. I’m sure lots of thoughts are swimming around your brain atm, I’m well aware I don’t understand many of them. That doesn’t need to be fixed right away, or ever really. You’re your own person and we all have our own private slice of hell in our brains.

I’ll ease off contacting you and let you control the pace of our interactions for now, I say this so you don’t worry that I’m annoyed or hurt by you. There’s nothing you need to beat yourself up about, you just need some alone time, we all do at some point. Take whatever space you need.

Excuse this essay, I hope you’re having as good an evening as you can given the circumstances. Finally I hope your neck isn’t giving you too much grief. Speak to you whenever’s right x
[06/01/2024, 07:40:43] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Helloooo!! Hope you got a good sleep :) yes sorry I think I’ve been winding myself up / been in overthink town for a couple of weeks and it’s just kind of peaked. I’m sorry for getting upset and for worrying you. Everything is fine I just think I need to find a way out of a rut

Aware that we’re hanging out with your pals tonight so I don’t want this to be hanging over that xx
[06/01/2024, 09:30:17] conall: Don’t worry about it honestly. It’s been an intense few days tbh so I totally get why it could bring some worries to a head. You don’t have anything to apologise for, you communicated what your needs are really well and that’s all I ever want. It’s scary to open up about these parts of ourselves so I appreciate you putting yourself in that vulnerable position, it helped to put a lot of things into a structure I can understand. Anyway I’ll shut up now, but in short, thanks. This text reads very HR speak to me but I hope you it doesn’t come across like that, I just hope you know I’m here if you need me. Have a good day x
[06/01/2024, 12:48:45] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It is a bit HR lol. But yeah I’m okay I’m just taking a breather!! But just wanna reiterate that I love ya and we’re all good xx
[06/01/2024, 13:48:54] conall: Glad to hear it. Love ya too obv and enjoy the space, no presh. Chat another time x
[06/01/2024, 16:26:12] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I won’t be out tonight cause I’m not feeling that well but hope you have a lovely time x
[06/01/2024, 17:22:06] conall: Aw cheers for letting me know, hope you’re feeling yourself soon. Ttly xo

You’ve given me loads of context to go off in these last 3 months, and you were really good at communicating what you wanted. Do NOT worry about it. I’ve never felt more loved by someone in my whole life, and honestly I don’t think anyone has ever found me as attractive as you either. We’re all good. Corny to say it but there WILL be challenges ahead, there always are, but we’ll be fine. LYO. x

[09/01/2024, 11:41:26] conall: actually no that’s my fault
[09/01/2024, 11:41:46] conall: to explain: found this very hot, not your issue
[09/01/2024, 11:42:07] conall: I spoke to Kate about it and came to a similar conclusion but NOT that it was boring
[09/01/2024, 11:42:41] conall: I just like looking at good things sometimes and that was a series of little vignettes that were all very satisfying to look at
[09/01/2024, 11:43:09] conall: it was a bit lacking in “stuff going on” but I took that as deliberate tbh
[09/01/2024, 11:43:44] conall: it sounds like her life was pretty dull, being cooped up in that gaff all the time
[09/01/2024, 11:44:24] conall: so yeah I guess it was boring but I kinda thought that was the point so it’s not boring if that makes sense
[09/01/2024, 11:45:37] conall: ffs can’t stop thinking about this
[09/01/2024, 11:46:25] conall: Need to work. Have a good day. Say hi to Roben for me
[09/01/2024, 12:19:17] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I love watching you stood above me anyway so should probably start telling you to take your clothes off while you’re at it x
[09/01/2024, 12:19:39] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yeah this is kind of my read too
[09/01/2024, 12:20:22] Zoë “cringe” Turner: But we also thought it was paced a bit strangely, like a lot of time spent on the build up and then not a lot of time on her having the affair, doing her own things etc BUT again I think the focus was her ENTRAPMENT
[09/01/2024, 12:20:47] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Whenever I criticise I film now I imagine your mum in All Saints
[09/01/2024, 12:21:04] Zoë “cringe” Turner: also you did fall asleep just saying
[09/01/2024, 12:21:27] Zoë “cringe” Turner: BYEEEEE she’s excited that you’re back on BeReal, didn’t like your hiatus
[09/01/2024, 12:21:35] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m meeting Jules after work too
[09/01/2024, 13:42:10] conall: I HATE following instructions
[09/01/2024, 13:42:20] conall: (unless they’re from you)
[09/01/2024, 13:43:28] conall: Yeah I agree, it was like that film the boy in the bubble except it was Priscilla Presley instead of a boy and the bubble was Elvis / Graceland. That’s my review put it on the fridge
[09/01/2024, 13:44:00] conall: hahahahahaha I’d forgotten about this, in my head it was hollister but you are better at remembering than me
[09/01/2024, 13:44:11] conall: it’s great to be back
[09/01/2024, 13:44:38] conall: although clearly I’m out of the habit because my ? was wrong today. Disappointed in myself
[09/01/2024, 13:44:49] conall: aww nice one!!
[09/01/2024, 13:45:03] conall: sorry I didn’t give you her number 😬 cringeo dot com or what

[09/01/2024, 22:42:23] conall: ALSO this is really nice, I know it seems v stressful because it’s a lot but this is a process you’re going through. Better to be armed with what you don’t know and you can work through it (but you know all this). You’ll smash it babes x
[09/01/2024, 22:43:23] conall: honestly top tier vn this
[09/01/2024, 22:43:31] conall: might be your finest work yet

[09/01/2024, 22:46:07] conall: Can’t wait to be all “yeah my gf works in comms, she’s pretty high flyin”
[09/01/2024, 22:46:16] conall: the boys at the golf club are gonna love it
[09/01/2024, 22:47:27] conall: Love you loads. Obviously. I’m getting that bursting feeling again but I think it’s mostly just excitement. I’ll stop being a wet flannel and think some unwholesome thoughts to balance it out. Night darling x
[09/01/2024, 22:49:32] Zoë “cringe” Turner: awww thank you my love this is really nice to hear

[10/01/2024, 08:02:21] conall: Morning babes, sorry I didn’t get back to this last night. Me and Kate were having a bit of a DMC and as soon as my head hit the pillow I fell asleep
[10/01/2024, 08:03:13] conall: Glad that you like various things that I said though, I don’t normally aim to please but in your case I’m quite keen on it
[10/01/2024, 08:03:43] conall: Obviously this was a GOOD NIGHT love you, however nothing wrong with me sending a GOOD MORNING love you

[10/01/2024, 09:04:04] conall: also enjoy that book too
[10/01/2024, 09:06:19] conall: I’m about a quarter of the way through. It’s a new style of writing to me so it took a bit to get myself rolling (before I tumble down the hill, smashing all the villagers houses) but I’m moving with it now and enjoying it a lot. LOOK OUT TINY PEOPLE, YOU’RE IN DANGER
[10/01/2024, 12:05:31] Zoë “cringe” Turner: this is just what happens when you bring two cringeos together
[10/01/2024, 12:08:11] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Oh fun!!!! It is quite a unique style, it took me a while the gauge it too but it’s got a lovely rhythm to it, you can tell she’s a DJ/producer type person too. Poor tiny people, they probably like books too
[10/01/2024, 12:26:43] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hate that I said too three times
[10/01/2024, 15:05:01] conall: FUCK EM

[10/01/2024, 15:05:20] conall: and your shit tiny bookcases
[10/01/2024, 15:06:52] conall: what imaginary books would they have on their bookshelves, here’s the first ones I made up

Sisyphus: What a Ball Ache
Decorating Your Perilous Home

[10/01/2024, 18:15:13] conall: Got my fingers toes and eyeballs crossed for you tomorrow xx
[10/01/2024, 18:18:50] conall: oh and my mind
[10/01/2024, 18:18:56] conall: it's also cross(ed)
[10/01/2024, 18:19:50] conall: making myself angry about various things because crossing more stuff will probably lead to good luck. Can you BELIEVE the price of BREAD these days?!?!?!! 😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬

[10/01/2024, 22:58:07] conall: aww
[10/01/2024, 22:58:55] conall: RE: price of bread. I feel like mine is more down to earth and relatable to the common folk than your high society olive oil concerns. Big tory energy on that point
[10/01/2024, 23:00:05] conall: and yes! I’ll be about for both a chat after if you just wanna decompress a bit and I’m happy to meet you on your lunch. OR if you just wanna do one of them I’ll meet you for lunch. Unsure of the time we’re going to Nells but I can probs just show up whenevs? I’ll find out tomoz
[10/01/2024, 23:01:24] conall: Hope you’re already asleep with many thoughts about how you’d handle communicating to the media that a student has gone on a drug field murder rampage around Aflecks Palace
[10/01/2024, 23:02:17] conall: You’ll do great tomorrow. I’m VERY excited for you. Love you and speak soon. If you just wanna be in your own headspace tomorrow morning don’t worry about getting in touch. Love you and GOOD NIGHT xxx
[10/01/2024, 23:02:26] conall: lol said love you twice cringe. NIGHT
[11/01/2024, 07:15:30] conall: GOOD MORNING

Terrible sleep last night but I have gymmed and swimmed so that’s GOOD. Not that it matters though because you’re off to get yourself a job.

Good luck today babes. I know I said this last night but whatever. I’m currently getting annoyed about the price of avocados to both make sure you have more luck and because I am a millennial and this is why I haven’t bought a house yet

Love ya. Don’t feel obliged to reply if you’re just cracking on

YA GOT THIS xxxx
[11/01/2024, 08:17:21] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Sorry was just getting ready!! GOOD MORNING

Thank u for being so supportive I know it sounds cringe but it really means a lot a lot to me. I imagine I’ll probably be making that same sheepish face when I leave the interview as I kept doing every time I finished a climbing PUZZLE (lingo). 

I’ll talk to you properly after. Love you loads xxxxx
[11/01/2024, 09:07:07] conall: Don't worry about it babes! It's the bare minimum I can do. I can only say good luck in so many ways but I'll be manifesting for ya all morning (unsure of how to do that but I think you just think about things and they happen, idk I'll give it a go).

Looking forward to hearing from you and seeing your sheepish face. Love ya x

[11/01/2024, 12:56:41] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ok babe u do u
[11/01/2024, 12:57:19] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m sat at a table with like 6 seats because it was the only one available when I came in, and people keep staring me out while they’re waiting for a table by the door 😒😒😒😒😒😒😒
[11/01/2024, 12:58:03] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also some guy I went with a date with a year ago was in here and it was really funny watching him interact from outsider perspective

[11/01/2024, 13:04:18] conall: I always think it's so cool to see people you've dated, it makes me think of everyone's private lives they live and how we're all just bumbling along on our own to some degree
[11/01/2024, 13:04:21] Zoë “cringe” Turner: nah pure spy
[11/01/2024, 13:05:18] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I know right!! Like I was like oh I bet he’s still doing that PhD and he’s having a meeting
[11/01/2024, 13:05:58] conall: I think about the trails thing a lot
[11/01/2024, 13:06:12] conall: but especially if I've come across someone I have dated
[11/01/2024, 13:06:22] conall: that's a big trail moment
[11/01/2024, 13:06:52] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’ve been thinking about this watching Kate and Emily date and come in and out of the flats and I wanna write something about that concept but not sure what yet
[11/01/2024, 13:07:02] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Big trails indeed
[11/01/2024, 13:07:23] conall: Yeah I think of it a lot for that same reason
[11/01/2024, 13:07:28] conall: Kate's out now for instance
[11/01/2024, 13:07:35] conall: Leaving her trail about the place

[12/01/2024, 08:31:27] Zoë “cringe” Turner: alternative dinner plans if we don’t wanna make a smorgasbord: M&S dinner for two vibes
[12/01/2024, 09:14:42] conall: hehe
[12/01/2024, 09:14:47] conall: I've had another bad nights sleep tbh
[12/01/2024, 09:15:05] conall: but likely I'll just keep going until NIGHTFALL
[12/01/2024, 09:15:15] conall: tbh I would be up for this
[12/01/2024, 09:15:20] conall: let's do smorgs at home
[12/01/2024, 09:15:36] conall: I was putting together a vague list of middle easterny stuff
[12/01/2024, 09:15:55] conall: but my desire to just chill with you is outweighing a lot
[12/01/2024, 09:16:08] conall: also I'm quite sleepy so I think I just cba
‎[12/01/2024, 09:19:07] conall: ‎<attached: 00010265-PHOTO-2024-01-12-09-19-07.jpg>
[12/01/2024, 09:19:15] conall: my sister has been captured by a massive spider
[12/01/2024, 09:20:27] conall: just packing my flamethrower then I'm hopping on the first flight to the Philipines, sorry to miss our weekend away x
[12/01/2024, 09:24:54] conall: ALSO
[12/01/2024, 09:24:57] conall: finished the book
[12/01/2024, 09:25:00] conall: LOVED it
[12/01/2024, 09:25:07] conall: a really goodread(s)
[12/01/2024, 09:25:28] conall: I was trying to remember bits I liked a lot but they're not coming to me now
[12/01/2024, 09:26:35] conall: I enjoyed the bit about her boyfriends just using the same algorithms in bed, and how she's lying on the ghosts of their previous girlfriends. That whole chapter was my favourite tbh. Kinda took Damla from a girl to a WOMAN in about 5 pages but not in a forced way
[12/01/2024, 09:28:12] conall: Also when her ex gets beaten up by Topaz (I think), he brings a sword back and she explains in lots of detail about what the sword is which I really liked. I imagine it's a reference to how guys can bore women with their stupid toys and the women just sort of remember this stuff whether they want to or not. She ends it with "I can't wait to leave it in the rain" which I found very funny
[12/01/2024, 09:28:53] conall: also the crush that she has on Cemile (just got there last night) I think isn't even alluded to, she basically says it from how I interpreted it
[12/01/2024, 09:29:15] conall: Sorry to splurge all this out now but I'll just forget it if I don't write it down somewhere. I should probably just take notes instead
‎[12/01/2024, 09:34:24] conall: ‎<attached: 00010277-PHOTO-2024-01-12-09-34-24.jpg>

I don’t always know how best to say these things cause it almost seems like it doesn’t need to be said in a way, cause everything about being with you seems so natural to me, BUT being with you all weekend and doing things we both LOVE doing has made me so happy (typed with traitor face but promise it’s true) and I just feel unbelievably lucky to have found everything I wanted in a person, it’s MENTAL. Thanks for telling me about that man who farted and then gave you side eye, a great and successful Hinge bit xxxx

[14/01/2024, 21:11:46] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Love you too
[14/01/2024, 21:11:47] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Can’t wait
[14/01/2024, 21:11:56] Zoë “cringe” Turner: see babe
[14/01/2024, 21:12:03] Zoë “cringe” Turner: The honeymoon period isn’t over like you said
[14/01/2024, 21:16:10] conall: I’ll also say: I’m actually running out of ways to describe how ace it has been meeting you. I still can’t quite believe it tbh. Idk why I feel some hesitation writing this but I know that’s very silly. I think I am also scared in my own way of giving myself over entirely to this, but I JUST can’t help it. Even things that are “issues” we chat about and just agree what each of us can do to help the other. It sounds really small but it means so much to me that we can communicate like that. ANYWAY, I remember reading somewhere that falling in love is a thing we can’t help, that’s why we call it falling. I didn’t really get it at the time but it’s starting to make sense now.

Weather report over
[14/01/2024, 21:16:23] conall: no VERY true

[14/01/2024, 21:33:33] Zoë “cringe” Turner: thinking about all the fun HOLIDAY THINGS

[16/01/2024, 10:05:28] conall: is the tiny animal tracks that are left everywhere
[16/01/2024, 10:06:18] conall: partly because it reminds me that these tiny animals are running about the gaff all the time, we just don't see them because they're shit scared of us and partly because it's just the silly trails thing I always think about but made REAL
[16/01/2024, 11:04:57] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Omg trail metaphor ACTUALISED

[25/01/2024, 18:07:39] conall: Unsure what exactly tipped me off tbh, just felt a bit different. No pressure to chat obviously but if you want a call or anything I'll be around later. We can chat about you or just talk crap for a bit. Either way I hope you feel like yourself soon x

[26/01/2024, 05:29:04] conall: GOOD MORNING BABES

I KNOW you’re feeling down atm, but know that it’ll pass, and it’s okay to feel low sometimes. You’re gonna have a lovely chilled day today, then later on I can make you some food, look after you a bit AND we’ll watch the traitors final 😯😮😳😨😲🫨🤯

Thanks for a fun call yesterday. My Mum has never been this effusive about anyone I’ve been with. I hope it doesn’t come across as “a bit much”, she’s just really happy and I think she can tell that I’m so pleased I’ve found you.

TRANSMISSION OVER.

Love you 🧹
[26/01/2024, 08:25:55] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hiya!!!!! Thank you for being so lovely about it, I appreciate you so much and I feel better for you just listening and being around 😚

I was thinking: WANT to do all of those things but I’ll need another mega sleep tonight - can feel it in my bones, to quote The Faithfuls - and would quite like a free Saturday morning. So we could see each other for a bit today and then do food/traitors finale tomorrow night and I can stay then??? Unless there’s something you wanna do tomorrow night in which case we will just do it tonight and I will swap mega sleep no issues. This is assuming you could even WAIT until Saturday for the finale. 

Aww NO it’s not a bit much at all, I really love that she’s this excited it makes me super happy. Likely because you’re obviously giving off #buzzing vibes and also because I’d trust her judgement having known you for 31 years x x
[26/01/2024, 08:26:12] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I love you, hope you’re having a good morning 🧹

[26/01/2024, 09:46:36] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Maybe we share some
[26/01/2024, 09:49:46] conall: Very glad you feel listened to, that's all I'm here for tbh (that and to go down on you every now and again, the two primary functions).

Yeah I get you babes, I won't lie I AM bummed but that's only because I just wanna "hey alexa why do I want to see my gf all the time and she makes me cry cos she is so beautiful". HOWEVER, we will see each other today. I've got some time off in the afternoon, so let's do that. My gaff is free all day, I'm a bit walked out because I've taken Fig on a 3 hour walk this morning so I'd offer a walk round somewhere but if you're up for that I'll get involved.

AND it kinda works anyway because tomorrow morning I wanted to get off to the peaks somewhere, get myself up some hills with Figgy Pudds.
[26/01/2024, 09:50:43] conall: So yeah, tonight I'm just gonna chill at home, play some GAMES with the boys and just enjoy Kate being out. Wake up and go for a hench walk tomoz, THEN see you for a nice day / eve / whatever. Can't argue with that really
[26/01/2024, 09:50:52] conall: I love you loads btw it's actually so cringe

[26/01/2024, 10:24:52] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I got my cry

I know it’s a bit bum but I think I just need to fester a bit and get lots of rest today and then have actual nice times tomorrow 🤞🤞🤞 ALSO if you’re not all adventured out from the peaks I was thinking we could do another big walk on Sunday like Tatton Park maybe??

[26/01/2024, 22:32:26] conall: “Sagittarius provides Leo with the deeper understanding they may be lacking, while Leo can fine-tune Sagittarius’s charm and social graces. Sagittarius may be irritated by Leo’s bossiness, shallow vanity and tendency to sulk. However, they are both loyal and devoted to one another, and the rewards of their union outweigh the minor setbacks.”

[28/01/2024, 22:48:02] conall: I won’t lie
[28/01/2024, 22:48:28] conall: I was always trying to understand what you meant when you alluded to all these feelings you get / ways you’ve acted
[28/01/2024, 22:48:33] conall: and I get it much more now
[28/01/2024, 22:49:18] Zoë “cringe” Turner: yeah :/// lmao

[28/01/2024, 22:52:21] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I once did go ape and I was terrified walking over this high wire
[28/01/2024, 22:52:36] conall: I don’t really need my own space THAT much, I just need to know that it’s available to me if I need it
[28/01/2024, 22:53:00] Zoë “cringe” Turner: So I just let go so that I KNEW I would just be safe in my harness in mid air and nothing would happen
[28/01/2024, 22:53:10] Zoë “cringe” Turner: And then I wasn’t scared
[28/01/2024, 22:53:20] Zoë “cringe” Turner: And I always think about that when I think about things like this

[28/01/2024, 22:58:03] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Kkkkk
[28/01/2024, 22:58:06] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Night xxxxxx
[28/01/2024, 22:58:18] conall: night bbz
[28/01/2024, 23:22:08] conall: right NOW i’m off to bed
[28/01/2024, 23:36:04] conall: finding it so hard to keep my thoughts straight on all of this stuff with you but I cannot think of a time in my life where I’ve been happier. Just ALL of it is so great.

I’m sorry I’ve been a bit grouchy this weekend at times, I hope you know I was never pissed off because you “took up my time” or something silly like that. I was just being typical me and not sleeping enough, then doing way too much exercise THEN being a total arse with you. I’ll work on that I’m sorry. Gonna call the doctors tomorrow to get my nose checked out and just get this train going because I NEED to sort this sleep stuff. It’s driving me a bit mad that I’m so headache-y and just knackered constantly.

ANYWAY, that was a side note but I don’t really know what this ramble is for, other than to tell you that I still can’t quite believe you exist. I feel like we’re so compatible in so many ways and it just sends me a bit loopy when I actually sit down to think about how good this all is.

Lastly, yes I do want to be with you for a long time. A VERY long time. Si cringe to say that 4 months in but I’m just obsessed with you.

Actually lastly, you’re so hot and I can’t get over how much I love seeing you orgasm. If I could do it 100 times in a row I would.

That’s ALL. I’m going to try to sleep but for some reason I’m all hyped up (hence this unhinged message I suppose). Love you obv. Chat tomoz xx

[02/02/2024, 10:56:12] Zoë “cringe” Turner: what !!!!
[02/02/2024, 10:56:25] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hehe
[02/02/2024, 11:07:37] conall: you’re just very cool that’s all
[02/02/2024, 11:07:43] conall: very cool gal
[02/02/2024, 11:08:06] conall: really enjoyed that film, it’s proper settled into my head now. Absolute banger
[02/02/2024, 11:08:22] conall: NOT a slow indie film imo but I get why people would call it that
[02/02/2024, 12:19:20] Zoë “cringe” Turner: it was every so slightly horrorish as well which I liked
[02/02/2024, 12:19:25] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Bit ghost story
[02/02/2024, 12:19:33] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Thanks for coming with me
[02/02/2024, 12:23:31] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I hope you know that I don’t take anything you told me last night lightly. I’ve intuited that it’s not something you’d want big sad or dramatic reactions to, so I guess I’m just choosing to concentrate on where you are now, which is what I think you want to do also. I just want to stress how blown away I am by you all the time, and I’ll keep trying to show it as much as I feel it (difficult because so much feel). That is all xxx
[02/02/2024, 12:37:52] conall: Thanks babes, as EVER you have intuited correctly. I feel much lighter having told you. I am mostly an open book but like everyone I have things that I just don’t let people in on. It means a lot that you’re the first person I’ve met since that I can talk to about it, that isn’t someone I’m paying. Others exist in my life to chat these things through with now, I know that, but I’m healed from it all now so it’s mostly just context for you to understand why I think the way I do about certain topics like connection, friends, relationships, blah blah.

To big myself up a little bit, I AM very proud of what I’ve managed to do in the last few years of my life. I’m not great at doing that but idk it’s good sometimes to recognise how far you’ve come. I’m very happy that we’ve met at this point in both of our lives. Words fail me to finish this sentence, but know that you mean a lot to me.

Frankly I need to stop talking about how much you mean to me for now because it’s getting me quite emotional and I can’t just wander round glassy eyed all day hahahahahahahaha

Love you loads x
[02/02/2024, 12:38:03] conall: also, extra point for that film
[02/02/2024, 12:38:21] conall: look at how the power of love video starts!!

https://youtu.be/WtdRv6GT9Zg?feature=shared
[02/02/2024, 12:54:44] conall: oh actually, one last thing I will say then I will shut up. It’s quite a heavy thing to listen to all of that, and I kinda sprung it on you without much warning. I didn’t mean to really, it just sort of came up. Anyway, I hope YOU are alright. Thanks for listening to me in the nicest way possible. That’s all I’ll say for now but thanks lots and lots and lots x
[02/02/2024, 13:23:02] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m really glad you’ve told me babe, I think it is just important to know for all those reasons you’ve already said. And I’m very happy to be someone you can talk to about these things, so yeah. I’m fine not to worry, just really really glad we are where we are, that I’ve met you now, etc etc etc. I’m VERY proud of you too. Now stop crying xxxxxxxx I love you!!
[02/02/2024, 13:23:54] Zoë “cringe” Turner: OH LOVE THIS
[02/02/2024, 13:23:58] Zoë “cringe” Turner: wow

[06/02/2024, 09:57:42] conall: i KNOW you’re all “you don’t need to be sorry” but I do feel somewhat responsible for the chain of events that took place last night. I’m not getting down on my knees and begging for mercy or something so don’t worry, I just wanna say thanks for telling me and I’ll keep it in mind going forward. I know I’ve already said this ALL but texting it feels like the right thing to do (gotta get these things in writing y’know).

Anyway I hope you manage to have a chilled (but hopefully not too boring) day at work. We’ll see each other when it’s right for us both x
[06/02/2024, 11:52:09] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It’s fine babe honestly, I think it’s just one of those things where we’re both in a habit and sometimes it’s better to just take a step back and be like are we both actually in this?? Yknow!! Thank you so much for making me feel better this morning it really helped to say it out loud and have you say all the right things xx
[06/02/2024, 11:52:32] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also things I needed to text you about:
[06/02/2024, 11:52:36] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Raw (film)

[06/02/2024, 11:54:14] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Can you ring the theatre today? (Request)

[06/02/2024, 21:34:45] conall: i think it just sort of spills out in my experience, if it’s any consolation I’d love you to be my PA but I don’t think that would be a healthy dynamic

[08/02/2024, 21:58:16] Zoë “cringe” Turner: In my brain
[08/02/2024, 22:05:31] conall: hey THATS not a moon phase
[08/02/2024, 22:05:51] conall: don’t test me about your lady bits

[08/02/2024, 22:06:22] conall: but i do know names of things
[08/02/2024, 22:06:27] conall: that’s funny
[08/02/2024, 22:06:30] conall: I think the same
[08/02/2024, 22:06:59] conall: I think it’s because I associate hinge with meeting people that were very much not a long term prospect
[08/02/2024, 22:07:02] conall: you however
[08/02/2024, 22:07:13] conall: throwing up a bit in my mouth saying this

[08/02/2024, 22:31:01] Zoë “cringe” Turner: nah it just feels like it’s all happened in a blur cause there’s been no thinking twice about it, and also hinge always felt so forced to me in lots of ways but this just feels of the naturalistic variety
[08/02/2024, 22:31:13] conall: hehe

[08/02/2024, 22:32:23] conall: I DO get what you mean. Even though I’m not as experienced in the dating apps I can honestly say regardless of where I’ve met someone this has been effortless
[08/02/2024, 22:32:55] conall: Just kinda feels like the right thing at all times tbh

[08/02/2024, 22:36:18] conall: it’s more that the thoughts are so ill-formed and rambling

[09/02/2024, 09:05:50] conall: how’s it going
[09/02/2024, 10:05:29] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Sleepy
[09/02/2024, 10:05:40] Zoë “cringe” Turner: forgot to brush my teeth again feel like an absolute minger
[09/02/2024, 10:05:46] Zoë “cringe” Turner: wbu
[09/02/2024, 10:40:30] conall: big bummer all round
[09/02/2024, 10:40:49] conall: work are gonna start asking if you're doing okay soon
[09/02/2024, 10:42:03] conall: I'm all good ta, got 6 hours sleep again but maybe this is just my body's way of getting back at me for the Big Sleep™️. Feeling p good though
[09/02/2024, 11:09:11] conall: So basically, I think about you often obviously but not in a "what's she up to" way. It's really cringe cos I sort of imagine doing things with you that I don't even think we've done. I was thinking about making soup with you this morning for some reason, I think it was because I've got leeks in the fridge. Occasionally they're sexual obviously but mostly not. I think my brain just likes you (lol) and enjoys these imaginary scenarios.

Aside, I haven't said this before but one of the MOST fun things about hanging out with Robin is just seeing you so comfy. I didn't say it at the time but you were v at ease and happy during that board game night and it was just LOVELY to see.

Lastly, I really enjoyed your answer to the "where would you time travel to", I think it says a lot about you. This happens a lot where you'll say some innocuous thing and I'll think "god I love her" but I already say I love you LOADS anyway so I didn't say it in this case
[09/02/2024, 11:09:27] conall: There you go you asked for it
[09/02/2024, 12:33:25] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Awww my love
[09/02/2024, 12:33:44] Zoë “cringe” Turner: You REALLY love me don’t you
[09/02/2024, 12:33:54] Zoë “cringe” Turner: hehehe 🥲
[09/02/2024, 12:34:05] Zoë “cringe” Turner: This means so much to me, thank you for telling me all this
[09/02/2024, 12:34:29] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I imagine doing literally everything with you all the time too
[09/02/2024, 12:35:09] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Right not to be all QUOTES about it but do you remember that one that’s about needing to find someone who’s better than your own solitude ?????
[09/02/2024, 12:35:27] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Cause I love my solitude but I think you’re better
[09/02/2024, 12:35:31] Zoë “cringe” Turner: LOL being sick xxxx
[09/02/2024, 14:17:05] conall: like a bit yeah obv but not like cringe levels you know

[09/02/2024, 14:17:32] conall: A LOT
[09/02/2024, 14:18:18] conall: Whenever you’ve sent me these random messages I’ve honestly loved them so much so even if they are disorganised I’m glad you liked it
[09/02/2024, 14:18:57] conall: when you reckon you’ll be hot to trot tonight? I could swing by you / meet you at the tram stop on the way to Folk if you wanted
[09/02/2024, 14:47:31] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Whatever Trevor
[09/02/2024, 14:48:02] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It wasn’t even disorganised I thought it was very well articulated
[09/02/2024, 14:48:05] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also babe
[09/02/2024, 14:48:20] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Pretty sure I dreamt I cheated on you with Harry from Traitors last night :(
[09/02/2024, 14:48:29] Zoë “cringe” Turner: it was gross

[09/02/2024, 14:49:57] conall: in the dream
[09/02/2024, 14:50:02] Zoë “cringe” Turner: No
[09/02/2024, 14:50:12] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I just knew you would
[09/02/2024, 14:50:13] conall: what was your response
[09/02/2024, 14:50:16] conall: so many questions
[09/02/2024, 14:50:24] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I dont think I even wanted it to happen
[09/02/2024, 14:50:33] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It was a non linear narrative
[09/02/2024, 14:51:08] Zoë “cringe” Turner: He’s a traitor, I’m a traitor
[09/02/2024, 14:51:11] conall: idk why cos it’s obviously a silly dream but I’ll just be honest and probably a bit cringe and say
[09/02/2024, 14:51:14] conall: I don’t like it

[09/02/2024, 14:51:56] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I just thought it was funny cause it’s so detached from reality
[09/02/2024, 14:52:06] conall: but WHO wants to think of that
[09/02/2024, 14:52:08] conall: not I
[09/02/2024, 14:52:19] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Well ME NEITHER
[09/02/2024, 14:52:29] conall: omg if you actually cheated on me with him years into the future

[09/02/2024, 14:52:36] Zoë “cringe” Turner: omg shut up

[11/02/2024, 21:32:21] conall: ALSO forgot to say but my dad made a very lame joke last night that might have bothered you. I won’t say it because if you didn’t clock it then I guess it didn’t lmao
[11/02/2024, 21:45:36] Zoë “cringe” Turner: no idea, probs a scam (gonna tell myself that anyway)
[11/02/2024, 21:45:48] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Right I’ve ordered it
[11/02/2024, 21:45:53] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Very excited BUT
[11/02/2024, 21:46:07] Zoë “cringe” Turner: They didn’t let me choose a delivery date???? So not sure what I’m supposed to do if I’m at work
[11/02/2024, 21:46:18] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Might have to call them tomorrow
[11/02/2024, 21:47:00] Zoë “cringe” Turner: aw it’s okay babe, I did clock it but know he didn’t mean it / wasn’t to know so it didn’t bother me
[11/02/2024, 21:56:03] conall: rager
[11/02/2024, 21:56:15] conall: i’ll be right

[11/02/2024, 22:02:37] conall: probs a joke you’ve heard a lot as it’s the v boring v standard bi gag. He’ll be horrified when he finds out but I won’t tell him soon cos I don’t want to make a big thing of it / make it seem like you’ve made a big thing of it
[11/02/2024, 22:03:11] conall: anyway thanks for understanding. bloody PARENTS
[11/02/2024, 22:05:53] conall: on a side note I can’t stop thinking about when I was playing with you while getting you to imagine various scenarios from your fantasy you mentioned. Unsure how I’m STILL horny but you just have this effect on me. It’s not even that I’m like “omg the fantasy is so hot”, it’s more how you were reacting when I was talking to you. Ugh you make me utterly feral
[11/02/2024, 22:16:55] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Ahaha yeah it’s no issue babe don’t worry him with it !! We SHOULD make our minds up quite frankly, easier for everyone to understand
[11/02/2024, 22:22:45] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I loveeeed you asking me those questions, I like you helping me to imagine filthy things and listening to you talk about them

[11/02/2024, 23:06:51] conall: Thanks for being so great. I love you on so many levels it’s insane. Literally the only thing I’m compromising on in this relationship is that I prefer my gf’s to have bigger heads, but it’s not a total deal breaker for me. Night x
[11/02/2024, 23:07:16] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Look at you honestly
[11/02/2024, 23:07:31] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I can’t deal with it
[11/02/2024, 23:07:53] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I think this is probably when you were telling me you’d wanked to imagining similar things
[11/02/2024, 23:08:15] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m also going to sleeps
[11/02/2024, 23:08:22] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Dosser the sloth actually in bed lmao

[13/02/2024, 22:08:26] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Night
[13/02/2024, 22:15:44] conall: That sttings a bit. I’m quite in the dark here so I didn’t do the full “love you” etc. I didn’t know if that would make how you’re feeling worse or not so I just aired on the side of caution. Obv the wrong move but that’s why I did it. Anyway, I’ll leave my phone on loud if you want to call. No probs if not
[14/02/2024, 08:14:41] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I just thought you were pissed off, sorry. I’ve got myself all tangled up and I know what I’m doing. If I start to feel like I’m not good enough for whatever reason I end up pulling away to almost prove myself right. It’s really stupid. Obviously you weren’t gonna be all like love you cause I’ve been acting like this, but it’s what I wanted to hear anyway. And I do feel like an idiot, so I didn’t really know what to say to your voice message
[14/02/2024, 10:46:27] conall: I get that. I’m sorry I didn’t do it last night. I hate talking about this stuff via text because so much gets lost so I’ll keep it short, you’re more than I could ever want in someone, I love you, and I also have the same thoughts as you about not feeling good enough for this. Thanks for telling me what’s on your mind x (very sincere)
[14/02/2024, 11:17:28] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’ve just found your card !!!!!!!!! So now the above message looks less sincere in comparison sorry

I love you so much, thank you for holding space for me even when I’m being an insane person. I’m so sorry if I’ve made you feel in any way shit, I just have some bad habits that come with being a bit scared. But it seems like you know that already. It means so much to me how patient and kind you are when I feel like I don’t really deserve it. I’ll see you later xxx
[14/02/2024, 11:58:52] conall: Hahahahahaha babes dw. It means even more to me that you sent that message before you read my card actually. I’ll explain why later on.

I’m not about to sack this whole thing off because you got a bit scared. I LOVE ya alright? You might not believe me because that’s how brains work sometimes but the thought of you not being good enough for me is absolutely laughable.

And shut up you do deserve it. You were hurting and you lashed out a bit. That’s it. No biggie x

Have a good day. I’ll say I love you once more because I went a whole DAY yesterday without saying it and it felt very weird. Sorry about that. I’m not without my own issues with this stuff that we can talk about when we want to.

LOVE YOU.
[14/02/2024, 12:04:52] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Love you so much that when a toddler sat opposite me on the train is eating a whole boiled egg, I think about you
[14/02/2024, 12:06:36] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hope you have a good day too. I’ll give you a bell when I’m on my way back 😚

[15/02/2024, 11:12:34] conall: Aww I LOVE these texts
[15/02/2024, 11:12:38] conall: My fave genre of text
[15/02/2024, 11:13:07] conall: The “we’ve just seen each other but here’s a message telling you I love ya” genre
[15/02/2024, 11:14:09] conall: I feel the same babes, and don’t worry about being stressed. We all get stressed at times and if it’s something that you think you want to work on then there’s TONS of stuff out there that’ll help. You don’t have to become a meditation wanker
[15/02/2024, 11:15:18] conall: I had so much fun last night and honestly my brain is still mush from what you did to me. I know I keep saying I hope you enjoyed it but I think that’s just my brain being stupid. It was really nice of you to spot that I just needed a bit of attention (or whatever a good way to phrase it is). Love you loads xxxxx
[15/02/2024, 11:38:03] conall: Also absolute flash back city today

[15/02/2024, 11:45:20] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It was so sexy when I was making you come and you were playing with my pussy in that position
[15/02/2024, 11:46:16] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I just love giving you the attention you deserve
[15/02/2024, 11:53:45] conall: I’ll show you

[15/02/2024, 11:57:33] conall: ugh
[15/02/2024, 11:57:52] conall: found it so hot when you had to lean back to let yourself orgasm
[15/02/2024, 12:06:08] Zoë “cringe” Turner: omg it was so hot watching you do this
[15/02/2024, 12:06:40] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I think I tried to push them open a bit before but I wasn’t firm enough / you weren’t having it
[15/02/2024, 12:06:58] Zoë “cringe” Turner: hehehe yeah I could tell by the way you were moaning into me
[15/02/2024, 12:12:52] conall: I think I was a little distracted

[15/02/2024, 12:13:19] conall: no chill whatsoever
[15/02/2024, 12:14:20] conall: “you like your ass being played with? Well I’m gonna tongue you as hard as I can then I’m gonna shove as much of my hand up there as possible”
[15/02/2024, 12:14:28] conall: talk about beside manner or what

[16/02/2024, 12:11:39] conall: you’d be full of yourself as well if you knew what I wrote in my #journal about you
[16/02/2024, 12:11:46] conall: even WHILE you’re being insane (your words)
‎[16/02/2024, 12:13:20] conall: ‎<attached: 00014125-AUDIO-2024-02-16-12-13-20.opus>
[16/02/2024, 12:13:31] conall: ewww got mouth noises on that
[16/02/2024, 12:21:56] Zoë “cringe” Turner: EWWWWWWWW
[16/02/2024, 12:22:08] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Can you just tell me one thing
[16/02/2024, 12:22:11] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Please
[16/02/2024, 12:22:14] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I deserve it
[16/02/2024, 12:22:15] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m insane
[16/02/2024, 12:25:04] conall: It’s mostly just lists of things you do that make me love you a lot
[16/02/2024, 12:27:38] conall: Well actually, I wrote a few things then but deleted them
[16/02/2024, 12:27:45] conall: I just found the most cringe one
[16/02/2024, 12:30:48] conall: In short I’ve never had particularly amazing self esteem. You have probably noticed that, but you seem to draw out of me this sense that I am actually a reasonable, attractive human being with some talents. I don’t know what it is that you do that makes me feel like this, I just think you’re a very loving person without necessarily intending to be all the time. I doubt I’ll ever be some ego maniac who loves themselves but it’s nice to get some healthy perspective
[16/02/2024, 12:31:23] conall: anyway cringe
[16/02/2024, 12:36:42] conall: also I can provide one of these another time because the thing I actually said was very me focused. But you’ve had enough for one day
[16/02/2024, 12:49:39] Zoë “cringe” Turner: hehehe
[16/02/2024, 12:49:47] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Reasonable he says
[16/02/2024, 12:50:17] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Like I’ve not literally told you you’re the best person I’ve ever met
[16/02/2024, 12:50:51] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m glad I can let you see yourself even part of the way I see you babes, means a lot to me
[16/02/2024, 12:51:52] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Anyway I’m just on my way to hozzie and thinking how I really love Withington, really craving a day when I just potter around withy
[16/02/2024, 12:51:58] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Feel like that’s all I ever used to do
[16/02/2024, 12:54:30] Zoë “cringe” Turner: also hilarious
[16/02/2024, 12:54:52] Zoë “cringe” Turner: swanning around with my London review of books tote and I’ve got 3 unread issues on my windowsill

[19/02/2024, 11:33:25] conall: Thanks for listening to me last night, I feel quite bad this morning but I think I’m really uneasy about conversations like that. I’m not very used to being able to be heard in the way you listened to me and as a result I end up getting in my head about being too much or causing you hurt or whatever. Idk it’s all very stupid on my part because obviously it’s all GOOD, and you’re great for letting me talk like that, I need to work on myself a bit and actually believe that it’s okay. Anyway scuse the essay, love you xx

[19/02/2024, 11:53:42] conall: in the flat I guess
[19/02/2024, 11:53:48] conall: idk why is everything so fucking hard
[19/02/2024, 11:54:21] conall: whatever guess i’ll just spend 3 hours on the phone to british gas even though they owe me £65
[19/02/2024, 11:54:27] conall: UGH
[19/02/2024, 11:54:40] conall: got a message from the debt recovery people today
[19/02/2024, 11:54:44] conall: asking for the money
[19/02/2024, 11:54:51] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Don’t do that today babe
[19/02/2024, 11:54:56] conall: I have to
[19/02/2024, 11:55:05] conall: it’ll just stress me out even more if I don’t
[19/02/2024, 11:55:43] Zoë “cringe” Turner: you’ve squared it with British Gas, it’ll likely be automated that they’ve sent that because BG haven’t communicated, I don’t think it’ll be a hard phone call like before
[19/02/2024, 11:56:12] conall: last time they fobbed me off but it’s okay
[19/02/2024, 11:56:19] Zoë “cringe” Turner: do it if you have to but don’t stress yourself out with anything else
[19/02/2024, 11:56:21] conall: i’ll get there

[19/02/2024, 11:56:54] Zoë “cringe” Turner: That sounds like a good plan!!
[19/02/2024, 11:57:26] Zoë “cringe” Turner: did you say you’ll come over later? I couldn’t tell 100% cause you said it quite fast lol
[19/02/2024, 11:58:16] conall: Sorry yeah I will if that’s still okay x
[19/02/2024, 11:58:29] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yeah of course

[19/02/2024, 12:01:06] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also you really don’t need to feel in any way bad about telling me how you feel, I’m glad you have. Sorry if I’m maybe not being super verbal about it, I’m also doing some processing but I feel good about the convos we’ve had. I know it feels vulnerable to do it and you don’t always know how someone is gonna react but thank you for letting me know what’s been going on for you, I need that in the same way you do xx
[19/02/2024, 12:43:06] conall: Thanks babes
[19/02/2024, 12:43:10] conall: I really appreciate it
[19/02/2024, 12:44:38] conall: Spent an hour on the phone to British Gas, they’ve deleted the email they sent me to say I don’t owe them any money. I sent it back to them and they put the phone down.

Pretty nice system. I’m gonna do a formal complaint with them with all the details in it, and then if that doesn’t resolve it I’m going to have to go to Ofgen
[19/02/2024, 12:44:41] conall: SO BORING
[19/02/2024, 12:46:30] conall: also, you were right lol. Bad idea to call them hahahahahaha
[19/02/2024, 14:24:31] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Are you joking????? Pathetic vibes from them
[19/02/2024, 14:26:00] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yeah just have a break / enjoy your swim and sort it over the next few days xxx

[19/02/2024, 22:47:55] conall: Thanks for an amazing dinner. I’m sorry you don’t feel quite yourself atm babes. There’s plenty of ways out of that, I know from experience that not accepting your body is a really tough thing to get over but it IS possible. I love you. I hope you have a great sleep.

[21/02/2024, 15:44:48] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Today is good!! I’m flagging a bit this afternoon cause concentrating in a dark room for hours is a bit tricky
[21/02/2024, 15:44:58] Zoë “cringe” Turner: But it’s been super nice
[21/02/2024, 17:16:48] conall: Yeah a bit, and also just mega stressed about all the stuff that’s come up this year, but I just stepped back a bit and realised I was being silly and how lovely it is that I have opportunity to do all these things hehe
[21/02/2024, 17:16:57] conall: hell yeah
[21/02/2024, 17:20:10] conall: wanna see Dune 2 as well which I think is out, it’ll be big and dumb and a bit boring but i fancy it
[21/02/2024, 17:20:26] conall: that end of the world film also sounds fun but i haven’t watched a trailer
[21/02/2024, 17:20:35] conall: i bet
[21/02/2024, 17:20:51] conall: what has the conference contained????
[21/02/2024, 17:21:03] conall: also miss u
[21/02/2024, 17:33:18] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Do you mean like trips and weddings and things?? It’s so overwhelming having loads to plan for but they’ll be so worth it
[21/02/2024, 17:33:28] conall: yeah exactly that
[21/02/2024, 17:33:41] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I haven’t seen the first one!
[21/02/2024, 17:33:48] Zoë “cringe” Turner: And what’s this????
[21/02/2024, 17:34:18] conall: just the whole forgetting about the stag do thing and then booking the holiday with you just got me mega stressed that I’ve missed OTHER stuff, then I start to spiral thinking “why am I going on these trips with all these people who barely like me this is so stupid”
[21/02/2024, 17:34:27] conall: which is obviously, an idiotic thing to think
[21/02/2024, 17:36:59] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Pause cause the sky looks beautiful
[21/02/2024, 17:37:22] conall: https://youtu.be/tsJkoKKSEcA

[21/02/2024, 18:50:51] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I think this is just another way of feeling overloaded presenting itself, but I’m glad you’ve managed to wiggle yourself out of it baby
[21/02/2024, 18:53:27] Zoë “cringe” Turner: The conference contained lots of performances and talks!! My fave was the panel (with cheddar gorgeous included), lots of ideas about queer resilience and freedom that I liked floating around. Plus it was just nice to watch some art stuff, it’s made me feel a bit more connected to the creative side of things again
[21/02/2024, 18:54:35] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Me and Oliver just sat out for a natter when we were a bit overloaded and we wanna start a little space where we can write regularly so gonna try and sort that 🤞

[22/02/2024, 06:42:11] conall: unsure why i’ve woken up so horny but I thought I’d let you know. Currently touching myself, thinking about the time you sat on my face and rubbed your pussy on my tongue to make yourself come. UGH you’re so hot babes. I can’t wait to see you
[22/02/2024, 07:01:55] conall: or when you licked my come off my face, I almost died a bit when you did that. OR when I was pressing my hand into your pussy after making you come, and you grabbed my cock like you just HAD to have it in your mouth.

[22/02/2024, 19:21:27] Zoë “cringe” Turner: And you were like yeah it’s quite a hot photo actually then put it in your pocket but I dunno which one
[22/02/2024, 19:21:34] Zoë “cringe” Turner: trousers ???
[22/02/2024, 19:21:36] conall: right okay
[22/02/2024, 19:21:42] conall: I think fleece for some reason?
[22/02/2024, 19:21:45] Zoë “cringe” Turner: that was in my room
[22/02/2024, 19:21:47] conall: but it’s not there
[22/02/2024, 19:21:56] conall: Idk why I think the fleece pocket
[22/02/2024, 19:22:07] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It’s probs in your car somewhere
[22/02/2024, 19:22:20] conall: It might have fallen out, the most likely spot is in the car
[22/02/2024, 19:22:33] conall: I’ll do a big search tomorrow and of the car park a bit too
[22/02/2024, 19:22:53] conall: Very disappointed in myself but whatever
[22/02/2024, 19:22:55] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It’s no biggie p

[22/02/2024, 19:24:20] conall: yeah it won’t be
[22/02/2024, 19:24:46] conall: I’m almost certain I had it in the car
[22/02/2024, 19:25:40] conall: so either it fell out in the car, or when I got out of the car. If it’s the latter it’ll have been in the car park for days and likely destroyed by rain
[22/02/2024, 19:25:54] conall: but I’m just gonna go have a quick scout round now anyway
[22/02/2024, 19:37:25] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Okay!!

[23/02/2024, 15:22:26] conall: I was quite torn between wholesome sex thoughts and not wholesome ones. First half was quite wholesome but then the second half was very much not. I could give more details but I don’t think you’re interested in that sort of thing. Why do you ask?
[23/02/2024, 15:22:50] conall: kind of a fun feeling though, a sort of nervous energy to it
[23/02/2024, 16:02:36] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Why are you being evasive?????? HM
[23/02/2024, 16:02:44] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Give the lady what she wants
[23/02/2024, 16:02:54] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Intrigued by what a wholesome sex thought is tbh

[23/02/2024, 16:33:40] conall: just like all loving and “oh she’s so great and sexy I love her loads omg I wanna do everything for her” hahahahahahaha
[23/02/2024, 16:37:40] conall: I was just imagining you being obedient for me. Getting you to use toys on yourself, bringing yourself to the edge and stopping when I tell you. Making you so frustrated that you’re being to orgasm. Getting you to kiss, suck and lick any part of my body that I ask you to. And OBV imagining you not following my instructions properly, and me teaching you how to follow my instructions in future.

Not very wholesome hehe
[23/02/2024, 16:51:35] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Okay well I love both of these modes

[04/03/2024, 05:31:27] conall: i had no idea what they were talking about (too drunk) but googled this morning and apparently this is a big tile man debate. I wonder if Tony in Levvie has opinions
[04/03/2024, 09:46:07] Zoë “cringe” Turner: If Tony in Levy is the guy I think he is, he wouldn’t stack his tiles
[04/03/2024, 09:46:39] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Top one looks gross
[04/03/2024, 09:57:43] conall: How’re you doing this morning babes? Good eve with Ryan last night??
[04/03/2024, 09:58:45] conall: I quite like the top one but I think i would like it more if they were rotated (incompatible tile preferences alert)
[04/03/2024, 10:15:14] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m good! Yeah it was really nice

[07/03/2024, 20:14:00] Zoë “cringe” Turner: No I know
[07/03/2024, 20:14:01] conall: Even if Saint John didn’t cover it’d be fine though, I’d get over it. Was just looking forward to sitting around with you that weekend a LOT

[07/03/2024, 20:15:27] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Well this was one guy
[07/03/2024, 20:15:39] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Then Oliver asked me to cover him with him cause he couldn’t deal with it
[07/03/2024, 20:15:44] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Then another guy appeared
[07/03/2024, 20:15:47] Zoë “cringe” Turner: And I was like hi
[07/03/2024, 20:15:51] Zoë “cringe” Turner: And he was like hi

[07/03/2024, 20:16:46] Zoë “cringe” Turner: And I was like fuuuuck this
[07/03/2024, 20:16:50] conall: yeeeesh

[07/03/2024, 20:17:44] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yeah it was only tough cause John was on his lunch so I didn’t have an easy way out and we were having to act around them because they were the kind of people you don’t wanna aggravate by ignoring or showing that you’re suss
[07/03/2024, 20:18:06] Zoë “cringe” Turner: So I had to be like ‘can someone get Ash cause I can’t get into this file’
[07/03/2024, 20:18:09] conall: yeah deffo know the vibe of person you mean
[07/03/2024, 20:18:17] Zoë “cringe” Turner: and he was like erm I’ll be 15 mins

[07/03/2024, 20:18:40] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Then they both left kind of together
[07/03/2024, 20:18:45] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Really weird
[07/03/2024, 20:18:55] conall: dealing with someone when you’re thinking “this could go south at any moment for any reason”
[07/03/2024, 20:19:06] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yeah exactly
[07/03/2024, 20:19:13] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Can’t phone security cause they’ll know

[07/03/2024, 20:20:18] Zoë “cringe” Turner: yeah init
[07/03/2024, 20:20:22] conall: hard to judge those situations but they left calmly so you clearly made the right move
[07/03/2024, 20:20:29] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I think silent alarm has been discussed before
[07/03/2024, 20:20:55] Zoë “cringe” Turner: thanks hun yeah ended okay
[07/03/2024, 20:21:03] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Then security did a sweep round

[11/03/2024, 09:38:50] conall: you get 6 free workouts with that link. It’s probs like the thing Ava has, put the equipment in and it just tells you what to do

[13/03/2024, 08:56:11] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahaha chic x
[13/03/2024, 08:56:12] conall: Thanks babes
[13/03/2024, 08:56:24] conall: Sorry I’ve been quite off this week
[13/03/2024, 08:59:25] conall: Idk what’s wrong with me atm, I feel (in the bluntest, very not medically diagnosed term) sort of depressed
[13/03/2024, 09:02:44] conall: I doubt it’s actual depression, I hope I don’t sound like I’m using the word flippantly. Just a big slump. It’ll be fine I’m sure I just need to do some work on myself a bit and make sure I’m not letting old habits get into my brain.

God bit much for a weds morning that hahahahaha
[13/03/2024, 09:11:19] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Oh babe :( I’m sorry
[13/03/2024, 09:15:21] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I guess to me you do seem a bit disconnected from yourself, and I think that’s only really been obvious since you went on holiday, but you might’ve been feeling like this before. I know that habits are super important to you and you’ve just been pulled in lots of different directions the last few weeks, maybe not putting yourself as very high priority, and feeling under appreciated for it. So maybe it’s about refocusing on yourself, looking at the next few weeks ahead (or just few days if that’s easier) and figuring out where your time is there/how you(YOU) want to spend it
[13/03/2024, 09:22:37] Zoë “cringe” Turner: And as an aside to that, you shouldn’t be worried about saying no to me. I know that might not be an issue here but just to note that if you feel like you can’t say it to other people at the moment, remember that I am gonna understand if and when you’re just not feeling something we had planned or not able to commit to something I ask about. Obviously that’s to a degree / contextual but basically if you’re ever feeling a certain way I can just adjust my expectations to that and then that’s absolutely fine with me - don’t think you have to be holding this up all the time is maybe what I’m trying to say
[13/03/2024, 09:55:10] conall: Thanks for all you’ve said babes, I really appreciate it. I do think you’re right in the sense that I feel like I’m being dragged about this way and that. Over the years I’ve learned how my brain works and realised that habits are really the only thing that keeps me from spinning out and becoming a wreck. I am normally pretty good at just sticking with stuff but these last few weeks have just been quite all over the place.

I think it’s a combo of feeling like I don’t have much agency in my life (which obviously isn’t true in the fullest sense), and just feeling like nothing I can do is enough. I’ve got these two stag do’s to sort out along with a whole heap of other crap and I’m just shutting down a bit. I guess looking after my sisters dog and then moving her in etc, all to be told that she doesn’t have time to go for a catch up meal until April kinda stung too. Makes me feel like I’m just “useful” for people to have around. I’ve barely seen Dan since I moved her in her flat, because she’s off with her new life. It’s fine, but it just makes me feel like I’m just a dog’s body.

I know that’s not true if I think it through, it can’t be or else my life would be very different. It’s just been a few circumstances recently that have all stacked up on one another and my brain is mapping it all on to this grand narrative. I know it’s not true intellectually, it’s just hard to get there sometimes when there’s all these little bits of evidence
[13/03/2024, 09:56:13] conall: And I know babes, don’t worry I don’t feel pressured by you or anything like that. I love hanging out with you, and I never want to give you the impression that you’re dragging me away from somewhere I’d rather be
[13/03/2024, 10:16:46] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I think you’re right my love, and this is all a lot to have going round in your head when you’re also trying to do your day to day stuff, and new things keep popping up. 

I do think there’s probably an element of thinking these things about yourself - that you can’t do enough, that you’re only useful to people etc. - maybe that’s always there, and then when these things happen in quick succession it kind of proves the narrative you’ve already built about yourself. Not to be all therapy about it, and they’re valid feelings to have given the circumstances, but sometimes these things start from the core of us don’t they. 

You’re an extremely giving person, and you’re hard on yourself. So I think sometimes those two things can collapse into each other and it’s easy for you to forget how much people love you, but people do love you an awful lot. Ok ????????????????????
[13/03/2024, 10:18:28] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I don’t get that impression at all, I just wanted to remind you that I can move around you yknow
[13/03/2024, 10:19:32] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It probably hasn’t helped that I’ve been ill and pathetic this week, I’m sorry about that!!
[13/03/2024, 11:32:40] conall: Yeah I think that's right. That's what I was referring to when I was talking about my brain mapping it onto this grand narrative I've got. It's not a great way to view myself or the world and I need to shake it off tbh. I think my thoughts ARE valid but at the same time it's not caused by anyone being mean to me or anything. It's just been a collection of things that have all come up. I'll be alright I know, thanks for listening to me baby
[13/03/2024, 11:32:49] conall: Nah you've been great babes
[13/03/2024, 11:33:00] conall: I love pathetic Zoë she's so funny
[13/03/2024, 13:10:55] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Shaking it off isn’t really an easy thing to do though babes, just take little steps. I know you’ll be fine but it’s okay to be feeling like this now xxx

[13/03/2024, 20:52:06] conall: eric booked it
[13/03/2024, 20:55:20] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m not sharing with any of your snorey mates
[13/03/2024, 20:55:24] conall: okay
[13/03/2024, 20:55:26] conall: so i checked
[13/03/2024, 20:55:34] conall: i have a room to myself (yay)
[13/03/2024, 20:55:39] conall: but it’s a single bed (booo)
[13/03/2024, 20:55:53] conall: it’s all booked and paid for so here’s the options
[13/03/2024, 20:56:39] conall: we stay there, sleep on the floor by taking the mattresses from the bunk beds (one room has a double bed and a bunk bed) and fashioning some double bed from that
[13/03/2024, 20:56:44] conall: that’s option 1
[13/03/2024, 20:56:47] conall: option 2
[13/03/2024, 20:56:51] conall: find some other accommodation
[13/03/2024, 20:57:33] conall: I’d rather option 1 cos the bed won’t be awful AND it’s london marathon that weekend so prices are v high

[13/03/2024, 21:04:00] conall: It’s funny cos we lived in London at the same time but didn’t reconnect until I’d moved out to Hertfordshire. I’m sure I’ve said this but we didn’t talk for like a 8 years
[13/03/2024, 21:07:26] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Aw no I don’t think I knew that

[16/03/2024, 17:29:36] conall: vom
[17/03/2024, 10:13:48] conall: Love you loads, I guess I keep apologising because I know how tough these things are to deal with and it’s a lot for YOU to take on while also having your own shit to be getting on with.

Thanks for this week, I’m sorry we had to have that talk yesterday. I hope you have a chilled night tonight, and that we can see each other for an evening next week. Maybe go to the cinema or something
[17/03/2024, 11:05:19] conall: also writing this last message while looking at this was a very hilarious experience
[17/03/2024, 11:50:46] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I love you babe!! These things are gonna happen, peaks and troughs etc, it’s just part of being #messy people. Nobody needs to feel good all the time, I’m not mad or annoyed or anything like that, last night I think I was just struggling to explain that it has been a little tough not having your usual self about, but I think that’s totally normal. I hope today makes you feel a bit better, I think you’re going to Vic baths???? I have been telling you that you’ll love it there for ages !!
[17/03/2024, 11:51:30] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Next week I am free Wednesday eve and Sunday eve when I’m back from Stoke :)

[17/03/2024, 12:03:42] conall: not enough teeth
[17/03/2024, 12:06:31] conall: but yeah you’re right babes. I beat myself up about these things but I forget often how understanding you are and I wish I’d just had this talk with you earlier myself, it would’ve saved a lot of guesswork on your part. I know it sounds silly but I sometimes just don’t realise how my brain is until I talk / write about it. It’ll all be fine though, these next few days I’m gonna sort myself out and you’ll get the full Conall™️ experience on Wednesday.

I love you loads and if someone took a bit of my brain out in a test tube when I was younger, to then grow something in a vat for me later. It wouldn’t be half as good as you because I don’t have enough creativity to know that people can be as ace as you are

[19/03/2024, 10:05:38] conall: confused as to what this means
[19/03/2024, 10:05:58] conall: 2 matching wines? Is that two wine menus or 2 wine tasting things
[19/03/2024, 10:06:17] conall: Either way I’m gonna say that the wine was a bit much and we’d rather a voucher for just the meals instead
[19/03/2024, 10:06:40] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I think they’re trying to fob us of with 2 glasses of wine
[19/03/2024, 10:07:07] Zoë “cringe” Turner: :///////////
[19/03/2024, 10:07:31] Zoë “cringe” Turner: The wine WAS a bit much wasn’t it I felt like a wine mom
[19/03/2024, 10:07:40] conall: Yeah it was heavy business
[19/03/2024, 10:07:40] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Proper wino giggles
[19/03/2024, 10:07:46] conall: hehe you were cute
[19/03/2024, 10:08:06] conall: hmmm i’m unsure of the wording tbh
[19/03/2024, 10:08:19] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also this is so endearing for some reason
[19/03/2024, 10:08:51] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’d just ask for clarification and maybe hint that 2 glasses of wine is a bit shit
[19/03/2024, 10:09:22] conall: Yeah
[19/03/2024, 10:09:27] conall: My plan is to again play dumb
[19/03/2024, 10:09:41] conall: and just write in an assumption that they mean 2 wine pairing things again
[19/03/2024, 10:10:11] conall: and based on that assumption just say “well give us the food voucher cos it’s cheaper”
[19/03/2024, 10:10:14] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Ahhh like ‘just the food would be great thanks!!’
[19/03/2024, 10:10:21] conall: yeah exactly
[19/03/2024, 10:10:23] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Smart
[19/03/2024, 10:10:45] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I don’t know if they’ll take the bait
[19/03/2024, 10:10:47] Zoë “cringe” Turner: But smart
[19/03/2024, 10:10:51] conall: it’s the move I think
[19/03/2024, 10:11:05] conall: they’ll HATE to be all “erm no sorry, we just offered you two glasses of wine”
[19/03/2024, 10:11:18] conall: cos they know that’s not gonna butter my parsnips
[19/03/2024, 10:11:32] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Haahahahhaha
[19/03/2024, 10:11:34] conall: you’re obsessed that’s why

[25/03/2024, 12:21:48] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Ok amazing :)
[25/03/2024, 12:22:29] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Sorry I’m just thinking a lot about my health stuff atm as both my stomach and sinuses have flared up and it’s just making me feel a bit out of control I think
[25/03/2024, 12:23:06] Zoë “cringe” Turner: And being out and about / at yours adds another layer to thinking about food
[25/03/2024, 12:23:21] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Plus I was just rushing around this morning
[25/03/2024, 12:23:27] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Will be fine after cinema hopefully

[25/03/2024, 12:25:08] conall: I’m thinking of just making a soup?? Leek and potato is on my mind, feel like I’ve not seen a vegetable in days
[25/03/2024, 12:25:47] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yeah that sounds great
[25/03/2024, 12:25:52] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I just need plain food atm lol

[25/03/2024, 12:27:37] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Let me know if I can pick anything up
[25/03/2024, 12:30:32] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Think I’m gonna stop drinking for a while 😒

[25/03/2024, 12:33:17] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It’s obvs just super inflammatory
[25/03/2024, 12:33:36] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Okkkkk
[25/03/2024, 12:33:52] conall: Yeah, not worth it babes

[26/03/2024, 07:58:22] conall: Morning babes, hope you’re feeling okay today xxx
[26/03/2024, 10:07:13] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Morning xxxx
[26/03/2024, 10:07:26] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’m a bit rough but ok!
[26/03/2024, 10:07:39] Zoë “cringe” Turner: How’re you??
[26/03/2024, 10:35:52] conall: I’m doing alright! Had a bit of a tough chat with Federico this morning but that’s to be expected. No improvement to how you’re feeling I take it? :( I’m sorry I can’t help more babes
[26/03/2024, 10:45:06] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Oh no :( what did he say??
[26/03/2024, 10:45:19] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Noo I feel so sick today
[26/03/2024, 10:45:23] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It’s getting me down
[26/03/2024, 10:45:41] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Gonna call docs tomorrow and see if they can do anything
[26/03/2024, 10:54:15] conall: It was just quite a tough convo cos he was very “what is going on you can’t do this” etc etc. I get it, he’s pissed off so I can’t argue with it
[26/03/2024, 10:54:19] conall: aw babes
[26/03/2024, 10:54:53] conall: do you think it’s an anxiety sickness or a sickness sickness? I know that’s probably hard to tease out so dw if you can’t tell
[26/03/2024, 11:06:01] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Was he nice enough about it though or not ??
[26/03/2024, 11:06:21] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Nah it’s deffo proper nausea stuff
[26/03/2024, 11:18:08] conall: I guess it was just quite stern and very “wot u doin”
[26/03/2024, 11:19:02] conall: I’ve decided I’m not gonna go on that stag do though (the one before we go on holiday). I’m gonna do an inventory of my life later and just start to clip things off. Thanks for the advice yesterday babes I really appreciate it, especially when you’re feeling so shit. I love you x
[26/03/2024, 11:19:15] conall: Ugh babes I’m sorry
[26/03/2024, 11:19:23] conall: Let me know what the doctor says tomorrow
[26/03/2024, 12:16:47] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hmm yeah fair - he just kinda has to be like that really doesn’t he, and obv it’s an adjustment for staff when you don’t usually have people following you on stuff but then someone starts
[26/03/2024, 12:18:06] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Ah really?? That sounds like a good idea babe, just clearing the cache (me being tech). You’re welcome I hope it’s helpful xxx
[26/03/2024, 12:18:57] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Balancing stuff is super hard and with limited time you’re just kinda forced to prioritise if you wanna enjoy things properly
[26/03/2024, 12:19:17] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I will !
[26/03/2024, 12:19:30] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also
[26/03/2024, 12:19:46] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Actually no you’ll have pottery
[26/03/2024, 12:19:59] conall: go ooonnnnnn
[26/03/2024, 12:20:13] Zoë “cringe” Turner: But Adam is doing a set at xs malarkey next Tues
[26/03/2024, 12:20:27] Zoë “cringe” Turner: We’re gonna go see him
[26/03/2024, 12:20:44] Zoë “cringe” Turner: If you fancy it xx
[26/03/2024, 12:21:37] conall: What time does it start??
[26/03/2024, 12:21:45] conall: I could do maybe a quick pottery sesh
[26/03/2024, 12:21:59] conall: I’ve missed like 4 weeks now lol, very stupid
[26/03/2024, 12:22:43] conall: Yeah exactly, it’ll be an adjustment for us both tbh. I think he needs to find the “ROLI” way of doing things and we need to come to him a bit more. It’ll balance out
[26/03/2024, 12:23:59] conall: hahahahahahahaha you knob, but yes very helpful. The idea of just focusing on local people is a really obvious one but one I hadn’t thought of. I’ve got two groups of people here that I’ve somehow lucked into hanging out with, and I don’t do it enough!!! I should be thankful for that and often I’m not
[26/03/2024, 12:30:25] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Actually not til 8
[26/03/2024, 12:31:13] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I might hold off and get tickets closer to the time though
[26/03/2024, 12:31:50] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Keep planning things in advance then not feeling very well and it’s a waste of money!!!
[26/03/2024, 12:33:12] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I don’t think you’re not thankful for it!! Just think you’ve been trying to be there for lots of people all at once
[26/03/2024, 12:35:19] conall: ahh that’s fair babes
[26/03/2024, 12:36:12] conall: well let me know what you end up doing / what his set time will be
[26/03/2024, 12:36:33] conall: Might work out quite nicely if he’s not on until 9pm or something
[26/03/2024, 12:36:53] conall: I wish I could give you a big hug rn babes
[26/03/2024, 14:06:26] conall: babes, what u doin thursday?

[26/03/2024, 17:54:37] conall: Actually Kate just said she'd make some food for us if you wanted?? She's off out for a date that eve so we'd have the place to ourselves after grub
[26/03/2024, 17:54:42] conall: Up to you anyway babes

[26/03/2024, 21:31:20] conall: I did think this cos I looked at this very list earlier today
[26/03/2024, 21:31:30] conall: but figured I’d ask just in case you had your own secret list
[26/03/2024, 21:32:01] conall: every little helps!!!
[26/03/2024, 21:32:17] conall: Hope you manage to get some rest bite soon babes
[26/03/2024, 21:32:54] conall: it’s been okay, I missed a meeting at work because I was stressing about other work stuff which is really stupid of me. Not sure what’s wrong with me atm I’m just highly incompetent for some reason hahahahaha
[26/03/2024, 21:56:30] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Rest bite lol

[26/03/2024, 22:19:41] conall: I used that in a message today
[26/03/2024, 22:19:45] conall: got rest bite on the brain
[26/03/2024, 22:20:05] conall: it’s a real cross to bear Zoë
[26/03/2024, 22:20:14] conall: bare? bear?
[26/03/2024, 22:20:50] conall: I was doing some reading today about being burned out excessively and apparently this is yet another thing I can blame on adhd
[26/03/2024, 22:21:54] conall: I am somewhat joking obv but I think it does my brain some good to read this stuff every now and again although I still find it all very cringe
[26/03/2024, 22:22:05] conall: What’ve you been up to this evening babes??
[27/03/2024, 07:29:45] conall: Hey baby, I hope you’re doing okay and I hope you’ve had a big sit AND a big sleep
[27/03/2024, 08:52:07] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hi!!!!! Sorry went to sleepies
[27/03/2024, 08:52:38] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hate to break it to you babe but it is in fact respite
[27/03/2024, 08:56:02] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yeah! I didn’t wanna say cause I know you do find it a bit cringe but this makes sense. Also it isn’t cringe and I think it’s important to just know this stuff so you’re not always wondering whether something’s wrong <333
[27/03/2024, 08:56:30] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Was literally just doing chores and sitting lol
[27/03/2024, 08:57:08] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Wanted to go the gym this morning but I’m so phlegmy and have a driving lesson at 1
[27/03/2024, 08:57:22] Zoë “cringe” Turner: So just gonna rest before that

[27/03/2024, 10:24:37] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I know it clashes with seeing u though soooo so I know for sure, we are together on Saturday & Sunday right??? Possibly also Monday?? (Emily mentioned that’s when they’re doing a walk or something)
[27/03/2024, 10:55:27] conall: Hey babes sorry had a busy morning
[27/03/2024, 10:55:44] conall: That’s fine if you wanna head to that, hope you enjoy it xx
[27/03/2024, 10:57:36] conall: I was chatting to Kate and there’s a night on Saturday that might be quite fun to go to. I’ve not had a boogie in a while so I kinda fancy it, it’d be a late one though so if you didn’t fancy coming we could chill in the day then see each other in the morning? Or we could both go, or if you wanna do something that night with me I’m also happy to sack it off and just do whatevs you fancy!! Won’t be a mega late one (finishes at 1am) so if I do go I’ll still be up bright and early for our Buxton trip
[27/03/2024, 10:57:55] conall: good luck with this though!!!!
[27/03/2024, 10:58:10] conall: You’re gonna be Micheal Schumacher soon

[27/03/2024, 11:09:34] conall: Would be nice to go to that if you fancied it??
[27/03/2024, 11:31:33] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I might leave you to it on Saturday night depending on how I’m feeling but everything else sounds good yeah xx

[27/03/2024, 23:23:30] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Sweet dreamz xxx
[27/03/2024, 23:27:06] conall: Thanks babes
[27/03/2024, 23:27:16] conall: It was so nice to meet your parents!!!
[27/03/2024, 23:27:30] conall: Hope you manage to get a good sleep, I’m sorry you feel so shit atm
[27/03/2024, 23:27:35] conall: I love you loads xxx
[28/03/2024, 01:08:51] conall: Sorry about being stupid about staying at yours. Idk what was going on with me sticking in the ground like that. I knew I was doing it too which makes it all the more stupid. You're right in everything you said about it not being very even with who stays at who's place and sorry I was being a fool earlier. I think I was just quite stressed tonight I suppose and wanted to make a GOOD impression but wasn't sure how and kept overthinking everything. Love you loads and hope you're having a good sleep xxxxxx
[28/03/2024, 08:19:02] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It’s okay babe, we were both digging our heels in for whatever reason. And I’m sorry I probably wasn’t thinking very much about how nervous you might’ve been last night, cause in my mind I’m far more worried about what you think of them, which is maybe also silly but we’ve all got stuff like you said. You were great with them and I really appreciate it xxxx
[28/03/2024, 08:19:50] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I hope you got the work you wanted to do sorted last night so you can crack on with other stuff today xx
[28/03/2024, 08:29:56] conall: Hey babes, don’t worry about it! I think we were just both stressed in our own ways and that causes friction where there needn’t be any. I always think these things are very funny because we had what many would consider an “argument” then. But it was just fine? We sorted it and we both recognised where the other was. That means a LOT to me so anytime these things happen I’m weirdly happy
[28/03/2024, 08:30:00] conall: I did!!!
[28/03/2024, 08:31:42] conall: Today is gonna be spent trying to work out how much money I’ve got next month / over the next few days. Work aren’t paying me until the 5th of April and I’ve got to pay £1750 of this stag do myself (2 dropouts, my portion and the deposit). Quite stressed about money tbh but it’ll be fine, I’m just gonna miss out on my ISA £250 bonus from the gov cos work have paid me so late :(
[28/03/2024, 10:21:29] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahaha yeah I feel the same, I don’t really see them as arguments cause it’s just pretty normal clashing of consciousness stuff. I’m glad we can sort them like we do xxx
[28/03/2024, 10:23:20] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Until the 5th????? Have they given you a reason? 😩 

Aw babe that’s shite about the stag money, I don’t think people realise what they’re doing when they’re not the organisers and the drop out/can’t pay etc. I’m sorry, it’ll come back though from everyone else right??
[28/03/2024, 11:18:29] conall: Yeah exactly, weirdly it’d be worse if we never clashed at all. I LOVE ya more each day it’s honestly so cringe
[28/03/2024, 11:19:37] conall: It just happens cos “start up” lol. It’s fine it’ll be right in the end it just throws me off organisation wise

And yeah it will eventually, either some people will join (unlikely) or I’ll have to ask everyone to pitch in another £35 each
[28/03/2024, 11:19:51] conall: Just means that for the next two months I’ll be almost £2k down
[28/03/2024, 11:20:22] conall: and annoyingly you can’t even pay using a credit card for this thing, it all has to be cash!!! My savings are being raided
[28/03/2024, 11:20:37] conall: Maybe now I can finally say I’m skint (except the £4k I have in my isa hehe!
[28/03/2024, 11:20:41] conall: *)
[28/03/2024, 11:21:26] conall: “hehe!” is so funny, I might start doing it more. Although I fear it will only drive more allegations of shiftiness / tricksterness
[28/03/2024, 12:29:45] conall: HEY babes
[28/03/2024, 12:29:59] conall: Keep bonfire night free pls
[28/03/2024, 12:30:16] conall: Kk thx no more questions kk bye
[28/03/2024, 12:30:33] conall: actually tell me if you’re not free that’s the only question
[28/03/2024, 12:31:51] conall: in fact
[28/03/2024, 12:31:58] conall: please be quick telling me if you’re free
[28/03/2024, 12:33:30] Zoë “cringe” Turner: On the 5th November ??
[28/03/2024, 12:33:33] conall: yes
[28/03/2024, 12:33:46] Zoë “cringe” Turner: No plans

[28/03/2024, 12:34:37] conall: that’s fine
[28/03/2024, 12:34:57] conall: getting dangerously close to a question there
[28/03/2024, 12:35:00] conall: but I’ll allow it
[28/03/2024, 12:35:23] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahahaha

[28/03/2024, 12:36:52] conall: unless it’s to read the wikipedia page about the history of bonfire nights
[28/03/2024, 12:37:42] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Ugh hadn’t even thought until you said that
[28/03/2024, 12:37:46] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Really want to now
[28/03/2024, 12:37:48] Zoë “cringe” Turner: The urge is strong

[28/03/2024, 12:38:38] conall: because I WILL
[28/03/2024, 12:39:01] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Don’t say that like it’s not all you want to do EVER
[28/03/2024, 12:39:05] Zoë “cringe” Turner: oh also
[28/03/2024, 12:39:12] Zoë “cringe” Turner: The thoughts I was having during the play

[28/03/2024, 12:40:13] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Included just staring at your hands and thinking wow they’re so big I want his fingers inside me

[08/04/2024, 12:54:01] conall: that's not how weddings work!!!

[08/04/2024, 13:02:25] conall: I've just messaged Sam on insta

[08/04/2024, 13:38:47] conall: However, we've been asked by both bride and groom to wear black
[08/04/2024, 13:38:54] conall: It's their wedding, so rules don't apply
[08/04/2024, 13:39:06] conall: I can see this being quite tough
[08/04/2024, 13:39:13] conall: On weds we can go through the options
[08/04/2024, 13:39:23] conall: Return the rest of them
[08/04/2024, 13:39:28] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Have they asked that though or are they just saying ‘yeah fine’ cause I’ve suggested it??
[08/04/2024, 13:39:41] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I don’t want other people being like why is she wearing black
[08/04/2024, 13:39:41] conall: No, that's what we should wear
[08/04/2024, 13:39:54] conall: Charlie asked for black, he's confirmed that with Sam
[08/04/2024, 13:40:37] conall: There is one rule, wear what they tell us to
[08/04/2024, 13:40:42] conall: And we're doing that!

[15/04/2024, 09:58:46] conall: also
[15/04/2024, 09:58:49] conall: another thing
[15/04/2024, 10:03:36] conall: I am so unbelievably happy with you and genuinely I still can’t believe that you exist. Sometime I wonder what life will be like with you in 5 or 10 years and it’s funny because obviously that’s kinda unhinged to think about but it doesn’t feel like that. It just feels like it’s gonna happen for sure and I can count on it. I’ve never felt like that before and honestly it gives me a weird sense of relief that I can’t quite describe. Like, it’s over! The search is finished. Call off the helicopters, the lights, the dogs. It’s found! Without being all soppy about it, I have not had amazing luck with my previous long term relationships and despite what it might have seemed I was holding quite a lot back at first. I don’t really think I am anymore and it just feels amazing. I love you Zo and I am very happy. That is all
[15/04/2024, 10:03:56] conall: woah that was longer than I thought it would be when typing
[15/04/2024, 10:40:41] Zoë “cringe” Turner: aw baby you’re gonna make me cry !!!!!!!!!!!
[15/04/2024, 10:46:10] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I know what you mean about not holding stuff back anymore, I can feel myself stopping worrying about wanting to be with you all the time or whether it will work out cause I just know it will, it’s almost unnervingly obvious!!! I never understood how people ever felt so sure and secure in their relationships but now I get it……. I love that there’s almost a mundanity to it but you make me feel excited every day just by being who you are. I’ve also never felt so comfortable telling the other person how I feel or when I’m anxious or annoyed or whatever but you never ever make it a problem and I love that so much. I love you so much I might EXPLODE.
[15/04/2024, 10:51:08] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Oh also happy 7 months 😘😘😘😘😘😘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘
[15/04/2024, 10:52:42] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also babes I’m sorry but I’ll have Taylor’s new album to listen to on the train to London xxxxxxxxx
[15/04/2024, 11:15:03] conall: I was wondering why I was feeling so unhinged today
[15/04/2024, 11:15:23] conall: Awwwww
[15/04/2024, 11:16:10] conall: I feel the same babes. I am just so excited to spend any time with you doing literally anything. It's the best feeling
[15/04/2024, 11:17:09] conall: Also I had a dream about fucking you in public last night, I think I came in my sleep lmao. It was so hot

I keep thinking about Crotia and seeing it as this weird “step” in our relationship. Like it’s some goal to reach or something. #FirstHoliday and all that. I don’t really know why this is. I think I’m just so excited at the concept of living with you that spending 4/5 days with you makes me GIDDY. I don’t know really what I’m saying tbh. I was just cleaning the bathroom and got very excited that you exist.

No response required, enjoy your day xx

[27/04/2024, 17:33:36] conall: why bother using my hands when I’ve got your mouth?
[27/04/2024, 17:33:57] Zoë “cringe” Turner: and yeah but don’t worry about it now babe, maybe just say something when you next see her/feel able to
[27/04/2024, 17:34:06] Zoë “cringe” Turner: She might be a bit embarrassed
[27/04/2024, 17:34:13] conall: yeah I think she is

[27/04/2024, 17:36:01] conall: it doesn’t actually matter if she goes y’know, like it has no bearing on whether or not I would go or not. Brain is all “well it’s unfair she has a fun night and I DONT”

I’d say I hope you’re doing okay but that would sound facetious. I feel a bit shut out, but equally I don’t want to push too hard. Take the space you need and I’ll be here if you need to talk. Good night, I love you xx
[30/04/2024, 22:04:25] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Yeah they have been a bit off! I’m not feeling v seen at the moment / have just wanted some space, but we can talk about it properly tomorrow. I love you too xx

[01/05/2024, 23:48:22] conall: i’m HOME
[01/05/2024, 23:49:27] conall: thank you for saying everything you’ve said tonight. I really appreciate you being able to talk to me about this stuff, although I am sorry that you’ve had to. I am endlessly interested in your brain and associated existence, I will be sure to make this clearer in the future
[01/05/2024, 23:49:32] conall: I love you loads
[01/05/2024, 23:49:39] conall: good night!!!!!!!!!Xxxxx
[02/05/2024, 09:17:37] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It’s okay babe, I don’t think I communicated it as fairly as I could’ve though really, im sorry about that
[02/05/2024, 09:20:55] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I still don’t feel like we’ve spent any real time together :( I am thinking I can ask Ry to meet me after work for some food tomorrow and come to yours after if you like, about 7.30/8? Then I can wake up with you on Saturday and we can do that day together with your pals?
[02/05/2024, 09:35:43] conall: It’s fine babes honestly, you just said how you were feeling and that’s all I can ever ask of you. About Friday I would like to see you but I also really don’t want you to miss out on spending some good time with Ryan. You’ve not seen him much either recently! Why don’t we do Saturday morning, do whatever all day Saturday then see each other all day Sunday and Monday? That’s still loads of time and we’ll get lots of alone time on the Saturday morning / Sunday day / Monday all day too
[02/05/2024, 09:36:23] conall: I hope that doesn’t come across as me not wanting to spend time with you, I do I just don’t want you rushing your meet with Ryan just to get to mine!!
[02/05/2024, 10:02:37] Zoë “cringe” Turner: I’d rather do what I suggested, is there another reason why you don’t wanna do Friday?
[02/05/2024, 10:04:52] conall: No I said my reason!
[02/05/2024, 10:09:32] conall: but yeah if you wanna come over at 8 on Friday that’s gravy with me
[02/05/2024, 10:10:17] conall: I just don’t want you rushing meeting with Ryan that’s all! We’ve got the whole weekend to spend together and you’ve only got a few hours on Friday with Ryan. Hope you believe me x
[02/05/2024, 10:10:28] conall: ALSO hope your driving lesson goes well
‎[02/05/2024, 12:33:47] Zoë “cringe” Turner: ‎<attached: 00024177-AUDIO-2024-05-02-12-33-47.opus>

[02/05/2024, 13:25:49] conall: Aw dw about the driving stuff, you’ll get back to it soon enough babes. I’m reliably informed you’re making excellent progress
[02/05/2024, 13:26:31] conall: Thank you!! I’ll get through it, hope your work is okay too xxx
[02/05/2024, 13:26:39] conall: Have you exercised your democracy rights
[02/05/2024, 13:41:52] Zoë “cringe” Turner: It’ll be a nice weekend :) and I’m gonna eat with Ry cause I’m not drinking so we thought we’d do that instead!
[02/05/2024, 13:42:20] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Hahah yeah hopefully, I’ll be back to my Weds slot next week
[02/05/2024, 13:42:32] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Nah I wasn’t registered lol

[02/05/2024, 14:12:00] Zoë “cringe” Turner: Also I have quite a lax approach, I think people call it 80/20 where you eat good most of the time but don’t deny yourself treats
