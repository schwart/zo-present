Using every fibre of my being not to send an iMessage
-------------------------------------------
I’ll let you know about Weds. I may have to do some moving BS that night but I’m hoping not. Depends on the new landlord but I’ll let you know asap

Really enjoyed meeting you, have a good weekend and I’ll see you next week

I really hope you actually use WhatsApp in your day to day life and I haven’t just dragged you into a room of the internet for my own ease
-------------------------------------------
Oh yeah of course don’t worry - I actually could do Monday coming or some time Sat/Sun if any of those are easier! Was lovely meeting you too 😌
-------------------------------------------
conall
09:11
oh yeah don’t worry, I‘ve only got about 5 people I send imessages to. They’re like those japanese soldiers they found in the 70’s that thought WW2 was still going
-------------------------------------------
Monday will be best I reckon, saves me / my new landlord faffing you around
-------------------------------------------
Zoë “cringe” Turner
11:08
Honestly when people text me I’m like what year do you think this is
-------------------------------------------
Ok!! Monday as in two days from now yes?
-------------------------------------------
conall
13:24
might as well use carrier pigeon (which tbh does sound fun if I didn’t feel bad for the little birds)
-------------------------------------------
yeah that’s the guy. We could go to levvie? I’ve barely been and fancy checking it out, I bet you’ve got some good haunts there
-------------------------------------------
Zoë “cringe” Turner
16:03
So here’s another thing about (up and coming) east manchester
-------------------------------------------
None of the good places tend to be open until Wednesday
-------------------------------------------
Having said this I’ve just googled and at least two spots I like do exist on Mondays but I would probs recommend trekking here when there’s more available??? Is Chorlton good at Mondays?
-------------------------------------------
conall
16:16
Chorlton (plateauing, possibly declining) has plenty we can go to. There’s a nice bar called Man Bites Dog, let’s go there
-------------------------------------------
Zoë “cringe” Turner
17:14
Do you mean Man Bites Frog or have they opened a sister location? Funny either way
-------------------------------------------

I wish, they haven’t opened a sister location I’m just an oaf

Good job you’re fluent in bowls and stuff init
-------------------------------------------
Hahaha imagine, illusion paint. No I just know the ruffles are totally the same vibe
-------------------------------------------
Where is the bottom???! What is it for???! - said still with respect and love
-------------------------------------------
It’s called an oxalis triangularis apparently 🫶 and I have several that are dying because I’m not very good at remembering to water them, even a rubber plant which are famously hard to kill right??

I’ve just remembered I recently downloaded an app that tells me these things

I’m the same tbf. I’ve got a big wall of them in my room and I still forget to water them. Absolutely useless

hahahahahaha I didn’t really clock there was no bottom, I just thought it was a fun little shelf thing

also I went to the book shop you recommended today! I was cycling around and remembered when I got to dids, it’s ace. Got two books, thanks for the recc

This IS exciting - how else would I have known it’s actually called a false shamrock??

‘Introduced’ 🥹

Does the relationship status deepen the more you spot it..?
-------------------------------------------
Really! That’s so nice! What did you find???

Did I tell you it used to be looked after by this really sweet really old man and then the pandemic happened and he wasn’t there anymore :(
-------------------------------------------
conall
20:10
I’ve got more facts if you’d like. Well one more fact but I did go “ahhh” when I worked it out
-------------------------------------------
sadly it just means it’s not endemic, I’ll never deepen my relationship with my false shamrock
-------------------------------------------
I feel like it’s my spirit plant. I’ve got a very irish name but I’m not irish. I’m a false shamrock!
-------------------------------------------
Aw that explains a lot tbh. It was suspiciously lacking any staff in the back, you just bring the books to the coffee shop and they ask you how much they cost

06:18
Tell me the fact
-------------------------------------------
This was a big reach in interpretation from me here. Your explanation makes so much more sense given this is a plant app
-------------------------------------------
it’s true! Also I’ve just saved you as Conall Patrick in my phone because I couldn’t remember your third Very Irish name
-------------------------------------------
Wow you’re really going for this completion of the art history timeline and I respect it

they’re a distant relative of the sweet potato, I did some species tree walking and it turns out they’re BOTH dicots

unsure what a dicot is but it’s the class they’re in
-------------------------------------------
I enjoyed it. I want to get to “it’s complicated” with my false shamrock
-------------------------------------------
Tbf that’s better than what I’ve got you saved as (Zoë Plath) you’re at least using some parts of my real name
-------------------------------------------
ALSO last night I was chatting to my mates brother’s girlfriend (tenuous I know) cos they were DJing at Night and Day, I actually said the phrase “oh wow is that a Mr Preston tattoo?”

She said yes and wondered how I knew. It was just the same style as yours, but I did feel very worldly and knowledgeable for about 3 seconds
-------------------------------------------
I can’t! Very annoying. I have a few things I’d like to do though however I’m very hungover so I’m unsure how far I’ll get with any of it. What did you get up to last night?
-------------------------------------------
Zoë “cringe” Turner
07:53
This is insane, I wonder if all dicots taste the same…. ?? Also when you say species tree walking do you mean like an actual walk through the trees to find dicots or is this something else
-------------------------------------------
A brave goal to have
-------------------------------------------
Hahaha great, like I’m distantly related to someone who put her head in the oven 😎
-------------------------------------------
Amazing. She would have felt such an affinity with you in that moment. Someone came up to me in a club once and we had like a ten minute shouty conversation (because it was loud but also I guess excitement) cause she knew his stuff and really wanted one too. He might be a tattoo guy but his larger scale work is forging connections across the city
-------------------------------------------
Ew, I hate this feeling. Very bad at being hungover as I’d much rather be enjoying myself and always try to do things but inevitably feel worse, sending prayers
-------------------------------------------
Last night I watched (3) hours of Wilderness that new series where Jenna Coleman wants to murder her cheating husband - felt unsure about the revenge feminism angle and the British caricatures of an American series - then fell asleep at 9.30. So I’m doing ok
-------------------------------------------
conall
08:08
you can just tell me to eat a leaf of my plant, I can see that’s what you’re angling after
-------------------------------------------
nah much more boring. If you want to find relative species you basically walk up the tree, then walk back down it. How many steps you have to take it sort of how closely related they are
-------------------------------------------
08:19
hilarious, I think tattoo people have a whole world that I’m just not party too. It’s very cute. I feel like I’ve had a look behind the veil. My mate who I’m moving in with lent me her hoodie once and I think she said it was his design. It’s bright pink, very warm.

I was going to ask if you have any other tattoos but that question is probably best in person
-------------------------------------------
My Mum’s watching that atm and she said loosely the same thing. Wasn’t sure how she felt about it. Being asleep at 9:30 is an absolute dream though, I commend your clear headed-ness
-------------------------------------------
speaking of revenge feminism, I was reading Plath’s wikipedia page (very bleak, made me want to read her though) and apparently her grave stone has been vandalised a few times because it has “Hughes” on it
-------------------------------------------
You’re working today right?
-------------------------------------------
Zoë “cringe” Turner
12:08
Was it this transparent / have you done it yet
-------------------------------------------
STILL ON THE APP I’m with you now; no real forests, why do I keep trying to make this something it’s not
-------------------------------------------
Oh yeah he does do clothes too!!! Sounds like a winner - you were a tattoo person for that brief time where you were I assume cold. I have quite a few others, most of them silly, but yes I can fill you in tomorrow

ahhhhhh this is interesting. Cancelled in retrospect, embarrassing for him. Annoying as well cause I did really like Birthday Letters

I am working yep, we’ve not had any weird visitors in ages so I hope we have one soon to spice up the afternoon

yes / yes. It was fine. Not sweet. Not a potato
-------------------------------------------
you’ve got a wonderful imagination
-------------------------------------------
I was cold, but the warm embrace of the tattoo community heard my cries. Beautiful really. 

I look forward to hearing about the rest! I was trying to remember the Plath quote yesterday but I was very drunk and couldn’t stop thinking about ovens
-------------------------------------------
I’d never heard of him! Poetry always confuses me. I always think I just don’t get it. Who’s your fave poet?
-------------------------------------------
got my fingers crossed for you

Zoë “cringe” Turner

I feel like we’ve been tricked by nature. Kinda the same as when people tell me we have the same language pattern as birds. What does it mean ??? Well done for investigating though thanks
-------------------------------------------
Oh do you wanna read maybe my favourite poem ever? It’s by Hera Lindsay Bird, she is from New Zealand and is so deadpan but simultaneously in love with the world. She once signed one of my books of hers with an alligator… I think? I need to check what the animal was
-------------------------------------------
None of them came today. But they’ll be back soon enough
-------------------------------------------
conall
15:51
I don’t know but I’d like to, please direct me to a quaint coffee / book shop that will have the answers. I’m thinking of entering my bird era about a month from now

I’ve started a new classification system, I feel the order / genus / species stuff is a bit too much for today’s budding biologists to deal with

More plants will be added to the system in due course
-------------------------------------------
Love the name already, what’s the title of the poem? You’ll need to explain more about how she signed something with an alligator. Did she pick it up and dip it’s tail in some ink?
-------------------------------------------
Zoë “cringe” Turner

Vegetables too??? Because if so I just had aubergines for tea and can you add Aubergine somewhere North West

18:54
I’ll get it added pronto
-------------------------------------------
okay I have re-read and see what you mean now, I didn’t think she picked the alligator up but I also didn’t get that she drew one either. My brain refuses to cooperate today, thank you for your patience
-------------------------------------------
I’ll read it now and let you know what I reckon, cheers for sending it!
-------------------------------------------
I really like that
-------------------------------------------
I don’t really have the vocabulary to say why it’s good, but I really enjoyed it. Very “makes my brain think of a fun image” whatever the word for that is
-------------------------------------------
also what time would you like to meet at Man Wears Cloggs tomorrow? 7?

Zoë “cringe” Turner

You’re so welcome, I felt I just had to stay with you there for a bit

Success !! I don’t think I can sum it up very well either, I just think it’s gorgeous and switches tones in all the right places

Yeah it’s great. It’s got a really effortless quality to it, really impressive. I read it again just as I woke up and I keep spotting more bits I like. Thanks again for sharing it, let me know what others from this poet you like, I’m a fan

We all yawn. Yesterday someone was practicing their gallery tour with me and I yawned. That’s way worse isn’t it

You’ve placed satsuma really well here

How lovely!! You’re very welcome - I literally like all of her stuff but there’s another amazing one called Monica as in Monica from friends

I don’t watch Friends because it doesn’t make me laugh but I understood her dissection of Monica all the same

I should hope so since this one is a mere walk away from your house

That is quite bad, although you do work there so you’re probably a bit bored of the gallery tour at this point. I don’t think I’ve ever had a gallery tour! I just wander round like a gnat hitting a window. I didn’t realise this was something I could do

Thanks, I’m a natural botanist it seems

Thank god this was the next question I was going to ask. Bit busy at work today but I’ll try to get to it before I see you at Fan Blows Smog later on

Very glad it did. I woke up this morning (at 7:30 no less) and read a bit of the wikipedia for sinusitis. Not that interesting. The CAT scan images made me realise how crazy eyes are, and mine have felt weird ever since
-------------------------------------------
That wall is where I do my best thinking, you weren’t to know this. I had ulterior motives for suggesting it

Zoë “cringe” Turner
07:41
Mildly offended that you weren’t further compelled by my ailment but nevermind. But yeah I understand how the eye thing would’ve come out on top, they’re so spherical. A friend showed me his brain scans recently and they made his nose look obscene it was so funny. Do you think it would be your eyes or your nose that stood out most on a CAT scan??
-------------------------------------------
I feel used and the fritaya/frittata will only taste sour now
-------------------------------------------
conall
09:27
I read about various diagnoses then wondered what I was doing with myself. Also the eye thing put me off.

They’re awful aren’t they! I had a CAT and an MRI a couple of years ago (tinnitus / “time that isn’t appropriate convo for a second date” related), it’s mental to think that’s what I look like in some way. The medical system does not optimise for flattery
-------------------------------------------
%[/Users/conallmcginty/Desktop/zoe-present/00000172-PHOTO-2023-09-19-10-27-42.jpg]%
-------------------------------------------
From the scans I remember being so focused on my eyes that I barely remember my nose at all. What do you reckon it’d be for you? Eyes or nose? I’m open to a rogue third option
-------------------------------------------
That will only improve the flavour, you’ll thank me in time
-------------------------------------------
Zoë “cringe” Turner
11:40
Wooooooah. Is your right eyeball bigger than your left one?? I’m not sure I’d actually want to look at my head like this, would send me into a spin similar to ‘death is not a dark room’
-------------------------------------------
Also if you’re pretending that the arrow isn’t yours to avoid another compliment for how straight your lines are, don’t worry I’ve learnt to keep that admiration to myself
-------------------------------------------
My skull is just so small I think everything would look ridiculous. People love telling me how small my head is. Maybe it wouldn’t even show up
-------------------------------------------
conall
13:42
I’m sorry to tell you that it’s not my eyes, nose or scan. I’m a fraud. This is just a scan of someone with chronic sinusitis. I do have a scan like this, I’m sure I can dig it out somewhere. Maybe I could do a cyanotype of it, that’d be a fun birthday present for my sister. I’m sure she’d love it
-------------------------------------------
I’ll be crying out for arrow praise in time I’m sure of it. No doubt I’ll live to regret my decision to shut it down so cruelly
-------------------------------------------
I haven’t noticed that you’ve got a small head, it seems proportional to me but it’s possible I have different standards for what a small head is. Do you ever wear hats? I like trying on the hats of people with tiny heads, it never gets old
-------------------------------------------
also, how is the nose / steroid situation going? Any leads?
-------------------------------------------
Zoë “cringe” Turner
15:03
This spiralled. Reminds me of when my pal had scans of her empty womb for whatever reason and then kept them stuck to her fridge like a family photo. Anyway if you do go ahead and do that please let me know what your sister’s feedback is (it will still be better than my brother’s, when he got nothing)
-------------------------------------------
I did some Googling of my own about Leo’s and it DID say that you guys LOVE praise and respect, something about being selfish too
-------------------------------------------
I haven’t found my hat of choice yet so no, you could try my bike helmet though that’s always a good one. Me and my pal Sophie are kind of in a life long contest as to whose head is the smallest and when she put my helmet on it was far too small, so I guess I won. Thanks for telling me my head seems outwardly normal though
-------------------------------------------
So…..turns out it’s fully available to private pharmacies that charge the double the price. Who knew 🥹 so I’ve taken the bait and now I’m part of the problem
-------------------------------------------
conall
16:09
Lots of questions about this, you can’t answer them though. I like the sound of that pal.

I don’t think I will. She doesn’t like me much (didn’t get me a card, I’m sure I mentioned that yesterday). She wouldn’t like the joke. Unsure what to get someone who doesn’t like you, I’m thinking a massage
-------------------------------------------
Okay this made me reflexively google “leo selfish”. I have two comments:

1) This article is damning. I’m not like this! https://www.yourtango.com/2020337568/why-are-leos-so-selfish?amp

2) You’re actually more selfish than me according to the fine folks at So Syncd (very reliable source) https://www.sosyncd.com/the-most-selfish-zodiac-signs-ranked/
-------------------------------------------
Thanks I look forward to looking silly for 2 seconds and saying “wow your head IS small”. I like the idea of a lifelong contest that can easily be ended at any time. Is she working to make her head smaller for a future rematch?
-------------------------------------------
16:20
Great system, really great. I suppose you’re supposed to be thankful that you’re sorted now. I think that’s what’s expected of you anyway

Sarcasm aside I DO hope you feel less shite soon. I feel I’ve got a better understanding of how bad it is now I’ve skimmed the wikipedia page and got scared of eyeballs
-------------------------------------------
Zoë “cringe” Turner
18:07
As in really truly doesn’t like you or just doesn’t like you in a sister kind of way? I don’t think my brother really likes me either but we’re so fundamentally different I can just explain it away in that sense. A massage is definitely a ‘here to win you over’ kind of gift, bold
-------------------------------------------
Hahahaha. Not even the part where they compare you to Regina George? (Weird cultural reference). 

Bit yikes that I’m second in the order of selfish signs but I’m going to focus on this poignant quote: ‘However, we all have a tendency to be selfish at some point, and it’s not all bad.’
And remind myself that we could just back and forth with different astrology links for days until we’d justified our personalities as we see fit but we won’t because we’re bigger than that
-------------------------------------------
At this point I’m not entirely sure if either of us even wants to have the smallest head. I feel like I could leave better legacies
-------------------------------------------
18:19
Of course!! Independentpharmacy.co.uk is my saviour, maybe I’ll just shop there from now on. But thank you, I do feel better, sorry for being dramatic about it. Hopefully you never have to see my eyeballs scanned like that HORROR SHOW
-------------------------------------------
Are you pottering this eve?? Is that the word?
-------------------------------------------
conall
20:40
I just think she despises me, it has been noted by other family members. Very odd situation all round but I keep ignoring it and just cracking on anyway. Weird because the rest of my family and I get on very well
-------------------------------------------
I found that comparison especially unflattering tbh. I don’t wear pink on any day, especially Wednesdays.

I’m enjoying the astrology link back and forth tbh. I seem to be winning in some way. Although that is what a prideful Leo would say
-------------------------------------------
There’s probably a historical moment where having a small head was considered regal. Just think of yourself as the right aristocrat in the wrong time
-------------------------------------------
Nah you’re not being dramatic honestly. Chronic illnesses are really shit so you’re bound to have the odd “fuck this I’m going to cry away from the non-existent baked potato stall” day, dw about it at all.

I was going to say “but I want to see your eyes like that” but then realised that sounds like I’m a serial killer
-------------------------------------------
Yes! I’ve just got back. I’ll send you what I’ve been working on recently

I reallllyyyy want to know more about this situation especially as you’re literally going to Jesus Christ Superstar for her but realise this might be my nosey tendencies again so let’s park it
-------------------------------------------
I will play this card next time Sophie tries to take me on, thank you 👑
-------------------------------------------
Still can’t believe you thought spud-u-like still existed. That was a real throwback to walking round Debenhams with my mum on the weekends and trying to get her to buy me anything from Jane Nor so I’d have some cool points for school
-------------------------------------------
This is so nice!!!
-------------------------------------------
What will you use it for? We have so many in this house that are just kind of sitting and waiting for their fate
-------------------------------------------
This is giving sting Ray or tadpole or some kind of water creature. I’ll need the back story eventually
-------------------------------------------
I watched that Dispatches about Russel Brand the absolute creep, made lots of disgusted faces and then caught up with Ava on the phone while the cat hid from housemate’s boyfriend’s dog and did some weird contortions:

Nah I’m happy to talk about anything, given the appropriate circumstances. It’s a long story I guess though, probably best for in person. Family chat in a tile shop sounds like my sort of Sunday. As a bonus I can give you my rundown of Jesus Christ Supperstar
-------------------------------------------
Jane Nor didn’t ring any bells but I googled it (before you add it to the tally, I’m allowed because I’m not currently on a date) and the tote bags are bringing back a lot of memories. Very Y2K

Do you remember Joe Bloggs? I think it was a BHS thing, it’s basically all I ever got for my birthday’s. The lamp section was great too. They had tons of lights all turned on and it was very beguiling. RIP BHS
-------------------------------------------
04:29
it’ll sit and await I think. Might give it to my Mum on Saturday, she’ll love it AND my new housemate told me that we need more plants because the pot to plant ratio in her place is already way off. Bit of a faux pas to make it worse on my first day there
-------------------------------------------
I for one am SHOCKED at the Russel Brand news. He’s the last person that I’d ever imagine to be a creepy sex pest, I’m sure literally no one saw this coming

I need more details. Cats name, dogs name at least. More info required than that but it can wait. Also pic of said dog if you have one
-------------------------------------------
It looks quite satisfying tbh
-------------------------------------------
Update: just bit my shoulder. 3/10

Excited maybe isn’t the right word here….. fascinated? To hear more. Also: supperstar? I suppose he did have that really big famous supper one time. I admire your dedication to creating spin offs for absolutely everything
-------------------------------------------
They were SUCH social leverage. Only the really cool girls carried their PE kit in a Jane Nor bag. I wasn’t one of them, until I got a reversible McKenzie jacket in the JD sports sale which seemed to make me some friends. Wasn’t school weird. I have no recollection of Joe Bloggs but I’ve just found out it was inspired by the Manchester club scene??? Did you feel a kinship to that culture age 12??
-------------------------------------------
She’s probably hoping you’ll be supplier of said more plants but I feel like you should warn her that you can’t water them, even when someone leaves you reminders (or make sure you’re at least a few months into the contract before revealing this)
-------------------------------------------
Lmao RIGHT? I certainly did not. 

The cat is called Moo, I think she’s got anxiety and wahs a lot but she’s very cute when not wahing. The dog is called Bruce, me and him are on tricky ground. Had an altercation when I was left alone with him for ten minutes wherein he wanted to play, he’s quite big and I don’t really know about or love dogs, didn’t know how to play, tried to ignore him and shower instead which he didn’t like and just kept barging the door down. But I got a lift to work with him in the car this morning and we seemed okay. Is that enough detail for now??
-------------------------------------------
Only 3?! I think I’d get more satisfaction out of this personally
-------------------------------------------

13:38
Everyone loves a spin off. Without them we wouldn’t have illustrious shows like Joey. I’m glad you’re excited to hear about my weird sister. I would say I want to hear about your weird family dynamics but you know, I’m just not that nosy. Although you did tell me about the PhD Mum thing.

Which reminds me, we barrelled onto something else but I meant to ask. What’re you thinking of doing a PhD in?
-------------------------------------------
Hahahahah. Very funny thought you in a McKenzie jacket. Tiny head, big jacket is what I’m imagining

I know the exactly what you mean RE brand school weirdness. I hated the little strap bags because they just seemed shit, but after I got one (lost my other bag), I felt cooler and made a friend that I’m still friends with to this day. Very dumb.
-------------------------------------------
13:49
oh I won’t be warning her, she seems competent enough. She doesn’t like cooking though, and I love it (but I am NOT a cooking guy as discussed).

I’ll cook, she’ll water the plants. Unsure if I’m getting a good deal here tbh
-------------------------------------------
14:01
Great name for a cat. Funny to call an animal either a different animal or something a different animal does. Great bit.

It’s more detail than I asked for, but it has left me wanting even more. You’ve fed me a salty anecdote and now I need a watery story to hydrate myself (obligatory “I’ve been up since 4:30 AGAIN” situation today so my analogy game isn’t the best)
-------------------------------------------
wait who’s shoulder you biting
-------------------------------------------
Zoë “cringe” Turner
18:47
I live for people’s weird family dynamics; it’s how we’re made. The PhD mum thing hahaha. Ugh, it was a kind of fleeting idea to do it in creative writing and use it as a really structured way to write, but I dunno, this is an idea I’ve had approx every 3 years and the application process just seems a bit MUCH
-------------------------------------------
Wow well the McKenzie jacket was not supposed to make me a laughing stock !!!! Imagine if I still had it. What do you mean by little strap bags, I need to picture the thing that brought you and this person together
-------------------------------------------
I think it’s maybe slightly funnier when animals are called things like Kevin or Sue. Never gets old. My friend used to have a really weird cat called Kevin and I’d just find him in the bath most mornings.

I’m enjoying the bad analogies, especially since we both know that I’m obsessed with hydrating - that water bottle? Actually just full of pet anecdotes. God I really wonder what 4.30 feels like
-------------------------------------------
I did mean mine, realised it was ambiguous and carried on regardless
-------------------------------------------
19:04
Also did you know the new series of MAFS UK is out? A horse girl just called herself an animal whisperer and looks unsure about her match

21:16
Well you’ve struck a rich vein with my sister and I. Very odd situation that I would like to change but I have exhausted my options I think.

That does sound very fun, I’ve known people who’ve done PhD’s before and it seems to be really make or break. Some come out loving the subject and others come out hating it. Also you’re constantly fighting for grant money but I don’t know if you do that for creative writing, pens don’t cost much and they normally have paper you can steal from the printers. Do you think you’ll ever do it?
-------------------------------------------
Some googling has told me that they’re actually called “gym sacks”, which is a very odd name to me but here is an example
-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------
Thanks for validating my analogies, you’re very understanding. I didn’t taste an anecdote when you gave me some water but I might have been distracted by trying not to spill it on myself, your bottle has a wide mouth that irked me on first use. I guess you want to get as much water in you as fast as possible
-------------------------------------------
21:27
I didn’t know it was on, I think I’ve only watched the aussie one. Classic horse girl behaviour regardless. Does she whisper with all the animals Dr Doolittle style or just horses?

I’d say I’d watch it but if I’m not watching something with someone it’s no fun. Who’s going to listen to me say “bloody hell horse girls am I right”? The wall?
-------------------------------------------
I had to cancel going to the pub quiz to attend a washing machine emergency at my sisters house. I’ll send a video of my handy work. I think you’ll find I’ve done a fantastic job

Yeah, I feel like people doing them love to moan about doing them but you can also tell they’re very proud to have their thesis child. Unfortunately I do think you still have to ask for lots of money, if not for pens then just for the time to do it - I thought that as an employee of the Uni they’d cut me some benefits but it doesn’t seem to work like that 🫠 we will see
-------------------------------------------
OH THESE. Yes. I think these are cool by way of being not a bag, like it’s the only way you can have a bag without it truly being a bag and therefore you’re nonchalant and don’t care about school, just football and Soulja Boy. I’m glad you got one in the end
-------------------------------------------
I love that you kept this to yourself until now. Really laughing at the use of irked here for some reason. It’s literally not even that wide, have you ever drank from an Oasis bottle? Whoever is manufacturing those needs to fucking stop
-------------------------------------------
She does ALL the animals, she had a sheep on a lead. And I mean, that’s kind of what I was doing last night, just making baffled sounds to myself while some guy who looks dead behind the eyes read ‘I love you’ from his vows to a stranger; hers were just ‘don’t speak to me before I’ve had my latte in the morning * death glare ‘. There’s no shame in the solo watch
-------------------------------------------
Oh this is amazing. I assume the slow tilt is to make sure the washing liquid is all evenly spread around? Looks really effective, something I’ll consider having installed. 

Is this the sister that doesn’t hate you, and does she live here too??

ALSO: happy move day???? I think

Very lame system in the UK. Or I guess anywhere from my understanding. I wish more people could get some sort of “creative dole” that they could live on and just do what they liked. Maybe you’d have to show them what you did every 6 months or something. Seems only rich people ever get big at any sort of art, besides the few that sneak through the cracks
-------------------------------------------
Great analysis of the bag, I agree completely. It’s useful for nothing really. It was really inconvenient and it hurt if you had anything remotely heavy in it. Pointless but it did give me street cred for one brief, fleeting moment
-------------------------------------------
You haven’t seen my water bottle yet, thin mouth on that guy. I haven’t thought about Oasis in ages but last experience with it involved mixing vodka in there, then promptly spilling it down myself. I think I was wise to be cautious with your bottle
-------------------------------------------
Sheep on a lead sounds like what a bad Korn cover band from the west country would play as there final song

Damn you’re really selling it, I might have to take a dip. It’s such a car crash
-------------------------------------------
18:35
Thank you, I’ve really outdone myself here. This is the sister that doesn’t hate me (Niamh), Aoibhinn (the sister that hates me) wouldn’t ask me to do this even though she knows I could. She would see it as annoying that I am helping. A little taste of the dynamic there, an appetiser before the main course
-------------------------------------------
thank you! It’s has been a death march and it’s not even done yet. I’ve  got all my stuff to the new place, it’s taken so much longer than I ever thought it would.

Had a break to eat some tibetan kitchen, now I need to make a bed frame, assemble about 5 bits of ikea furniture, and build my desk. Not enjoying this BUT the flat is nice and I’m very glad to have moved.

How’s your day / afternoon / night gone / going / not happened yet (delete as appropriate)

False shamrock = straight on the window ledge, as it should be. PLEASE tell me you’re making the bed first so that you’re not about to sleep on that hard wood floor (or I guess on the sofa you presumably have). Very glad you feel good about the move, it’s a great feeling escaping from a not ideal living situation, I have experienced the same relief probably too many times. Also a break to eat Tibetan kitchen is maybe the most Chorltonesque thing I’ve ever heard
-------------------------------------------
I hope you manage to slog through the rest of it soon 🙏 sending moving prayers
-------------------------------------------
I don’t think it would’ve been the end of the world if you’d spilt anything on yourself via my weird bottle. I would’ve just laughed and then apologised like your ineptitude was my fault
-------------------------------------------
Had to google how to pronounce Aoibhinn in very typical English fashion just now. This is tantalising info. Also; for ‘not a cooking guy, just a guy who cooks’ you’re really going hard with the foodie analogies

20:19
My day / night / week is so dull cause I just keep getting re-ill. I was supposed to be working the late tonight but everyone kept telling me how awful I looked and then I had to leave the new coordinator by himself which I’m feeling bad about. He had lots of other staff in and has worked in the gallery for about 9 years so I’m hoping this is fine and there have been no fires, he would likely do a better job than me even if there were

Hoping my life returns to more exciting pastures soon

Speaking of false shamrocks, had some fennel recently. No idea where it’ll go on the chart. It’s completely thrown me, suggestions pls

I know its very cliche isn’t it. Glad to
be chatting to a salt-of-the-earth Gortonite (Gortie? Gortonian?), it’s helping me stay in touch with my roots. Really appreciate it
-------------------------------------------
Thanks, appreciate that. I’ve bought the right bookshelf but the wrong shelves. It doesn’t fit together. I thought Ikea was idiot proof! I DO love assembling flat pack furniture though, it’s my calling

Damn I should’ve asked you in person, always like hearing what people think it sounds like. I go hard with all analogies, not just food ones. My analogies go like a boiled egg, or a turmeric root, or bit of parmesan

Ah that’s really shite. The sinusitis thing still? I wish I could say something more poignant and caring but the only thing I can think is “I hope you feel better and this sounds very bad”

Is fennel that aniseedy one that goes really well with sausages? Hmm. Maybe with FS but like two points to the right, just slightly closer to sweet? 

Hahaha - do you think Gorton possibly has Blackpool vibes, is that what you’re getting at here? I’d love to compare the goings on of Big Tesco Gorton to Big Tesco (or equivalent) Blackpool.
-------------------------------------------
WHAT. Don’t they simply just come with the shelves??? That would 100% be my assumption. The last time I put together anything from IKEA I had quite an awkward flatmate who just kind of watched me struggling to put it together with one pair of hands  instead of offering hers, which I found quite funny. It forced me to fulfil my potential at least
-------------------------------------------
Sorry, I can’t unsee the two quite easy syllables it actually is, but wish I could for the bit
-------------------------------------------
08:58
I think so!! Might be a weird combo of things. But THANKS I am fine I just need the rest but it’s boring. What do you do in this situation?? Not quite functioning highly enough but not without restlessness? I might try and read an entire book today
-------------------------------------------
Omg. I have this one to catch up on. Okay technically she was more of a well-rounded farm girl but I went with horse for the sake of the call back. I can’t wait to find out why two of them were shouting at each other on the beach !!!
-------------------------------------------
conall
11:51
Unsure of your qualifications to say this actually, to my knowledge you haven’t eaten a leaf of your FS like some, more committed, botanists you may know

I feel like it does. People do the same face when you say “oh they’re from Gorton” or “oh I’m from Blackpool”. I would like to see the Tesco. I have a good people watching game I used to play in airports when I had to travel a lot, it’s called “would I wear that t shirt” (often the answer is no)
-------------------------------------------
The shelf sides (posts) are separate from the actual shelf bits. Clearly my spacial reasoning is quite poor. I am back at Ikea now, very bleak situation.

I think I would enjoy seeing you assemble flatpack furniture. I don’t know why I just have an image in my head of it being quite funny. Not enough hands, McKenzie coat getting in the way, water spilling everywhere from your outrageous bottle
-------------------------------------------
12:02
That’s a bummer. It’s almost better being fully ill so you can really commit to vegging out. I hope you feel better soon, it must really suck being ill for this long

I can’t really suggest anything because I am not a good ill person. If I get a bit ill I continue on until I get very ill, then I try to continue until someone who cares about me tells me to go to bed. Not a model I would recommend
-------------------------------------------
What’s your illness strategy? Read a big book? Watch a horse girl shout? Go to big tesco?
-------------------------------------------
Thank you for the callback, I do enjoy the fact you did that. However it put me in an awkward spot yesterday because I kept chatting about this horse girl and Kate was confused as to who I meant. She also hadn’t seen the sheep on a lead. It’s like she’s watching a totally different show

I don’t know if this was some sort of dare but I rose to it either way. I was quite surprised by the sharp undertones??? But I did pick the flower that looked like it was dying, so maybe that was just sour death. Did you go stem or petal? I did a bit of both for a well rounded experience. Hope I’ve proved myself as worthy to stay on the project 

An EXCELLENT game, I want to play. Your dismissal of so many T-shirts doesn’t surprise me considering one of the first things you told me about yourself is that you’re known for consistently wearing white T-shirts. Also: someone at work told me yesterday about a new, similar game, called ‘hard or soft’ where they just point at things and you have to guess which it is

I’m amazed that this is the picture I’ve managed to build of myself in such a short space of time. She sounds effortless, stylish AND unflappable.

16:44
Well okay, I certainly won’t be taking any further ill advice from yourself. Are you ill right now and just pretending you’re not?? Letting me dramatise my own circumstances when someone should definitely be taking you to a walk in?? 

My strategy today has been nap, read, eat, repeat and I’ve decided I’m going to be better tomorrow for the sake of someone’s birthday I have just missed. I’ve also made that fermented garlic honey for prevention purposes - gonna have to think of all the most inventive ways to eat it when it’s done
-------------------------------------------
Hahahahaha. I’m so sorry about this. Hope I didn’t make your first night there too awkward. The sheep on a lead was absolutely a thing but this proves my theory that nobody actually watches an entire episode of that show without taking their eyes off the screen; there’s got to be a secondary distraction otherwise it’s actually a bit too much to process
-------------------------------------------
This seems so obvious when they’re lying side by side. But I can say that from over here, I wasn’t there in the heat of the moment. IKEA is an overwhelming place, you’ve done well to turn it around so quickly

Zoë I can’t say how much it means to me that you put your tastebuds on the line for this project. You’re a natural. I didn’t expect you to go the distance but consider yourself a founding member of the team. Who needs that PhD anyway

ALSO very happy that you’re into “would I wear that t-shirt”, it’s been a fave of mine for years now. Very pleased to bring someone else into the fold. I wonder if Blackpool Tesco will yield better t-shirts than Gorton? Exciting research ahead.

As a side note, I drove through Gorton today and passed the big Tesco on my way to my storage unit. It is a very big Tesco
-------------------------------------------
Yes but if I purchased it, it would be initially as a bit, then I would realise that I look quite silly and not in the way I’m going for. Example: my Katy Perry US Tour t-shirt. It’s just pjs now

You should’ve bought this t-shirt though
-------------------------------------------
I’ve probably laughed for about 5 minutes now at the word unflappable

Also autocorrect / type suggestion thing informs me that “unflappability” is a word. What a time to be alive
-------------------------------------------
22:22
I am a bit ill but it’s mostly just the build up of about 3 weeks waking up at 5am. My sleep is very fucked atm and I really don’t know what to do about it. I’m in the process of signing up to the GP and I’ll go when I return from Parish

Good plan, I hope you’re feeling better - I’ve said that a lot, I need better cliches. The birthday thing confuses me but I am tired and two pints tipsy. I’m sure you make sense, you use words better than me. Please explain what fermented garlic honey is, it sounds fantastic
-------------------------------------------
You’re very correct. I don’t think we watched it at all and two episodes went by (although another friend threw rocks at the window, I may have said this already). The will is there to get into it and you’ve been very accommodating with my hobbies (eating plants), it’s only fair to return the favour
-------------------------------------------

I can’t ramble too much about this ikea trip because a) boring b) long c) still reeling due to excessive tiredness but just know I have a new “bad retail” anecdote. I may keep it in my water bottle

🫡 thrilled to be on board - we can talk pay rises etc etc further down the line. 

OH. In that case you’ve basically seen Gorton. I live opposite big Tesco just a few rows back. I’m gonna start playing the game by myself next time I’m in there, and will feedback. Maybe you can do the same when you’re passing through Blackpool? Then we’ll have a sense of the playing field
-------------------------------------------
My main question here is: were you at the Katy Perry US tour? I decided this tshirt was too much money for the bit, I knew it would end up in loungewear territory or there was a risk people would think I was being serious if I wore it to the shop.
-------------------------------------------
Hahaha - incredible that it’s a real word. One can simply NOT be flapped (though in all seriousness it’s not a word I would use to describe myself)
-------------------------------------------
13:04
I mean yeah I would feel rundown from this experience also, plus you’ve just moved house, which people love telling me is the MOST STRESSFUL THING A PERSON CAN DO but I’m not sure how accurate that is anymore, the amount we tend to do it. Unless we’ve just adapted to a certain level of cortisol who knows. But good idea - Parish might also knock you out for about 48 hours afterwards and you’ll perhaps be reborn 

As far as cliches go it’s probably the most appropriate. I’m getting better I think thank you!! Yeah no it didn’t make sense the way I wrote it, that was on me, it was my best mates birthday yesterday and I missed it to sleep more, so I’m going to go see him now. I hope you enjoyed the tipsiness and can have a restful Saturday??
-------------------------------------------
I hate the be that person who’s like ‘we spoke about this!!!’ But I did tell you about fermented garlic honey the other day and then you told me that people have to ‘burp’ stuff they ferment and I thought you meant into it & then we moved on which was for the best
-------------------------------------------
What time are you free tomorrow?? I will need to know more about a) your rock throwing friend and b) the bad ikea experience
-------------------------------------------

18:11
I’ll put you in touch with your union rep.

Oh fantastic. Please let me know, we should probably work out some sort of format to specify how good the t shirts are. It’s all been in my head so far. I feel like Gorton might win but you always put the place you’re from down a bit don’t you
-------------------------------------------
I was not. Unlike you I committed to the bit, it was a poor decision though. It’s a comfy t shirt, not a total loss. I think you made the right move but I am a bit disappointed I won’t ever see you in it
-------------------------------------------
I got halfway through drawing a flappability scale, you were on one end but I couldn’t think of anything funny to put on anywhere else. I had an idea about Condors but couldn’t work it out properly. I think my brain is slow due to the combo of Jesus Christ Superstar, 2 pints and a lot of indian food. You can just imagine I made something funny though
-------------------------------------------
I can inform you moving is STILL stressful. My brain is in a constant state of disorganisation and a thing that helps is having a physical space that isn’t. Now the physical space isn’t either so it’s all gone to pot. It will be done in a few hours though. Tonight is the last big push

VERY glad you’re feeling better. Hope you enjoying seeing your mate this eve. I’m not doing much tonight, just sorting out the last four boxes of my life and putting up a load of art. I am very bad at hanging pictures as it turns out
-------------------------------------------
18:22
Oh dear, I’m sorry to make you that person. I do remember this now. Our conversations in person have been very fun and covered a lot of ground. I think that’s why it slipped through. I’d like to try some of this honey, it sound divine. Can I buy it anywhere or is this a homemade speciality?
-------------------------------------------
right you’re going to think I’m obsessed with Ikea but I have to go back there tomorrow. Me and my sister are going, I thought I had curtains in my unit but I only have one, she also needs Ikea things.

I’ll be done at probably 11:30/12. If you want to meet straight after that I can get her to drop me in Levvie, or I can head back to Chorlton and bus it back later. What time are you available?
-------------------------------------------
LASTLY I was listening to Nick Cave on Friday because I haven’t really listened to him much except the big stuff. I was also reading his wikipedia page, his birthday was yesterday! I meant to say this, I can’t remember why I didn’t

I’m gonna start with the old fashioned notes app, a description of the tshirt and just a Y/N next to it and we can build from there?? What do you think. I know you love a graph but with the sweet potato already ongoing and you having tried to introduce a flappability scale today, I fear overwhelm
-------------------------------------------
I think you’re braver than me for buying the tshirt Conall. I am also disappointed in myself. I wonder if it’s still in the shop…
-------------------------------------------
Oh I know the feeling exactly and this explains why you’ve been rushing back and forth to Ikea for the right size shelf things/curtains you don’t have - I also cannot leave something like this unfinished and just have to resolve it by any means necessary before I can move on. I hope you get it all sorted tonight so it can start to feel like normal!! Send art pics
-------------------------------------------
19:51
I’m glad this is the reason you’ve forgotten hahaha, I don’t disagree. You quite literally just peel a load of garlic cloves and cover them in honey and wait for them to do their thing for a bit I guess?! I’m waiting for bubbles to appear. I think I was supposed to use nice raw honey, not the Stockwell tesco brand but honey’s honey init
-------------------------------------------
I’m available whenever so whatever is easiest for you - I dunno if you’ll wanna go back to yours with whatever you get from Ikea trip no.43 first? Just let me know, I’m only a 10 minute cycle away. Also if you don’t get a lift please don’t attempt to get a bus from Chorlton to Levy it won’t work; get the 5 min train from Piccadilly or cycle down the loop, it’s like a 25 min ride or something
-------------------------------------------
Was it?! I still follow his wife on Instagram for some reason so probably knew this somewhere in my brain. I’m a weird kind of fan of his, I mainly admire the way he thinks and tells stories, and whenever I’ve seen him I’ve felt like I’m having some kind of spiritual experience. He made a really good film 20,000 Days on Earth and I didn’t stop thinking about it for a long time

I wonder whether Jesus Christ Superstar was a spiritual experience for you. Looking forward to hearing about it

No that’s fine. I admire your cavalier attitude to this. I DO like a graph but only if it’s silly. If we had a system for this it would likely be a google sheet or something and how are we going to make that fun? Colour the cells? Make a “crazy” formula that adds up all of our scores and averages them? Ridiculous. Thank you for keeping me in line
-------------------------------------------
A) is the shop in Levvie
B) can we go tomorrow
-------------------------------------------
I’m the same. It’s annoying me even more now I’m so close to a fantastic cozy room. I can taste it (cooking analogy #54)
-------------------------------------------
I will send art pictures but I have been told by both nice and mean sisters that my bed needs rotating. I will maybe do this tonight but I have to get some satsumas first
-------------------------------------------
Honey IS honey. This sounds very fun. I’ve never fermented anything, I’d like to do it. I have more questions but I won’t ask them because I have probably already asked them and forgotten the answer

what on EARTH is going on in east manc. Why do they want to keep everyone out. What are you up to over there
-------------------------------------------
I will let you know the plans tomorrow, I might need to go back home because I’ll have curtains and the like. I won’t put them up or anything I’ll just drop them off then decide which bad form of transport I would like to take to see you. I’d bike it but I’m saving my legs (very lame I know)
-------------------------------------------
It was! I enjoyed what I listened to. I thought “oh this guy loves Leonard Cohen” then read his wikipedia page and he says on it “I love Leonard Cohen”. I felt like such a worldly individual.

I like that you follow his wife, and not him. I guess maybe he doesn’t have an account but I’m going to choose to believe he does and you just like getting second hand info. You’ve sold me on him though. I love Leonard Cohen so I think I’ll really like him. Thanks for the recommendation / getting a Ned Flanders tattoo
-------------------------------------------
We already have such a docket for conversation tomorrow. PLUS the tiles. This is going to be quite the day. I’m excited

I think I would prefer this, not because I don’t want to help you carry curtains around, but because I’m still on the go slow (in my healing era) so a bit later would be better anyway!! Lemme know ETA when you know - I am once again sorry about where I live x
-------------------------------------------
It’s not 😭😭😭😭 I’ve really ruined this for myself

Hey, long story but didn't go to Ikea in the end. Spent the morning picking up glass, I'll explain when I see you. Hopefully Kate has got pics
-------------------------------------------
Anyway I just need to get some food in me, get a shower then I'll be good to head down to levs. I think the earliest I could get there is 1ish?
-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------
this is what she sent me this morning, we had to smash it up into bits to take it outside. Took bloody yonks and I may have glass in my hand (idiotic)

Is 1pm alright for you or do you fancy later?
-------------------------------------------
Zoë “cringe” Turner
10:09
Has there been an isolated earthquake in your living room?? I’m so confused / please get the glass out of your hand
-------------------------------------------
Right so I feel like a let down & irked because I wanted to see you again before you go on your tower adventures but I’m super up and down and not feeling like myself so I feel like I probably shouldn’t push it today - even seeing Ryan last night was a bit of a slog, I’m really sorry to do this last minute 😔 I know we had a whole docket, and I had never heard or seen that word before
-------------------------------------------
conall
11:28
No need to apologise honestly. I was looking forward to seeing you, but I wouldn’t want to drag you out if you’re feeling like crap. I can head back to Blackpool tonight anyway now so it’s not a total loss

I’m back from Paris next Tuesday, let me know if you fancy a catch up later on that week. Sadly I haven’t had the time to research better cliches, but I DO hope you get better soon

P.S. Glad to have introduced the word docket
-------------------------------------------
It just shattered early this morning, no reason as to why. Maybe the rock throwing friend threw rocks again. Also the glass in my hand has not been removed as yet, I may need to go to A&E. Tweezers have not helped. In hindsight this date was doomed from both ends
-------------------------------------------
Zoë “cringe” Turner
12:19
I hope you have the most amazing time / stay safe and of course hydrated. Are you setting off first thing and can I still receive minor updates as and when they’re available?? I’ll just be here possibly figuring out a tshirt spreadsheet depending on how many compelling ones I see, you really blew my notes app idea out of the water with that one 

How about the Friday? Surely we’ll both be healthy, sane and sans glass by then. On a separate note I really hope you don’t need to go to A&E but if you do, hope you’re not waiting a ridiculously long time. Today is cursed! The table knew it from the beginning
-------------------------------------------
Also on this: the Push the Sky Away album could actually be great a&e listening, if worst comes to worst. He obviously doesn’t have Instagram, like any cultural icon with integrity. I haven’t listened to Leonard Cohen for a long time, any reccs appreciated
-------------------------------------------
conall
13:53
Aw thanks, I’ll deffo send some updates through. I’ll be stopping once or twice each day, then at the end obv. I’ll stay in touch so you know I’m not in a ditch somewhere. I am a bit worried because 3 airbnbs have cancelled in Stoke tomorrow. Need to find a place to stay pronto.

Good luck with the t shirt collection. I’ve got great faith in your skills. You’ve really shown your dedication with FS-Gate.

I think I’ll be fine, it is still in my hand but I think my body will just reject it. It’s happened with a splinter before and it took a week to come out. This is a little bit bigger but it’ll be fine.

Today IS cursed. Kate was meant to be on a date too, they just cancelled. So we’re assembling yet MORE ikea furniture and I’m trying to convince her that the guy actually does like her (his texts make it obvious that he does but she doesn’t think so)

How’s your day going? Got any plans other than checking your fermentation for bubbles, reading, sleeping?
-------------------------------------------
If I can find my headphones I’ll give it a listen on my way home. Being on a train with glass in your hand is close to the A&E experience anyway, I think it’ll suit. “Various Positions” is probably his most accessible album I’d say. It’s got some silly tunes on it but it’s always what I recommend first
-------------------------------------------
Zoë “cringe” Turner
15:03
I appreciate being on the ‘hi I’m not in a ditch’ list. Have you tried looking for places a bit outside of Stoke, like Leek or Crewe? I don’t know how far off track that would take you but it might be more likely that they don’t bail. I’m actually going home tomorrow evening, so if you end up with one option and it’s the street do let me know and I can try and do something about it
-------------------------------------------
I’m unsure about your hand to glass logic but if this is what you’re manifesting then yes fine I guess it will just jump out eventually. And oh bless her!! What’s wrong with us all today, maybe people shouldn’t date on Sundays. Now I’m a bit worried she had to do the same for you but I’m doubtful
-------------------------------------------
I’m actually doing some freelance stuff to try and feel a bit more normal and it’s WORKING. That’s a bit sad isn’t it but it’s digging me out of a hole. I’m glad because I have to get a tattoo tomorrow morning that I’ve already cancelled once and I think at this point he would just keep all my money and not see me if I tried to do that again
-------------------------------------------
15:14
These songs are so nice! I had forgotten. Also searching for him reminded me that that band I was banging on about when you were asking about my tshirt the other night (Boygenius) have a song called Leonard Cohen and it’s very good
-------------------------------------------
conall
17:41
It's getting to be quite a long list, I hope that doesn't dilute your appreciation. Very kind of you to offer but I've managed to find a place in Little Bridgeford, I think it's south of Stoke but unsure how long away. Any tips for places to eat? Funny that we'll be there at the same time. What're you going home for?
-------------------------------------------
It's already poking out a bit! I think by tomorrow I'll be able to get a grip on it. Also I forgot to say, yes Friday 6th October is great for me. We're testing the loading capacity of the docket to it's very limits. I'll have a think of something fun we can do when I'm slogging myself across the country this week
-------------------------------------------
wahey! Glad you're feeling a little better. Sometimes you just need to feel like you're productive and that jump starts you. What tattoo you getting? I hope it's as good as the serenity prayer
-------------------------------------------
17:52
Glad you enjoyed, I'll have to give Boygenius a spin at some point. I've been organising my stuff for the trip for the past hour or two and I've had Push the Sky Away on the whole time, I think it's played about 3 times now. I really love it, thanks for telling me about it. There's about 3 songs on there that are incredible, I don't know the names but I'll work out what they are in time for when we see each other again

let’s DO IT
-------------------------------------------
I was going to suggest this also, but assumed you were gonna be doing family stuff / busy

I’ve got nothing on all night other than staying with my airbnb host lady so I’d be glad to get out and see the sights

Zoë “cringe” Turner

What time are you anticipating being in the general area?? Because I could either a) get the train straight to Stone and meet you there or b) go home first and then walk/get a lift to swynnerton (character reveal: I don’t drive)
-------------------------------------------
conall
18:26
I’m going to set off about 7ish
-------------------------------------------
am*

it’s 150km, and I’ll be doing about 25km per hour on average
-------------------------------------------
I’ll make about 2/3 stops for 30ish mins each

Yeah please no maths

conall
18:27
okay

very roughly
-------------------------------------------
like, 8 hours after 7am

3/4pm
-------------------------------------------
I can share my location if that’s not too weird, you’ll at least know when I’m nearish then
-------------------------------------------
actually, I forget you’ve got a nosy streak. Maybe you’d enjoy the location thing
-------------------------------------------
That’s the ultimate nosy trove
-------------------------------------------
Zoë “cringe” Turner
18:30
Do you wanna meet me in stone around then before you go to the bnb?? Is that easiest? Cause I can do that, will just get the train there
-------------------------------------------
This whole thing is a bit weird already I think
-------------------------------------------
I cancelled today just to intervene on your sojourn to my hometown instead
-------------------------------------------
That is the most nosey thing I’ve ever heard
-------------------------------------------
conall
18:33
it’s not weird, it’s just a good bit. That’s what I’m telling myself
-------------------------------------------
speaking of good bits, I can’t wear nice t shirts on this trip so I brought the Katy Perry one
-------------------------------------------
I’ll share my location tomorrow morning on find my friends or something. Might as well commit to this bit
-------------------------------------------
Zoë “cringe” Turner
18:35
I think I saw it in the pile but didn’t wanna ask
-------------------------------------------
Okay we’ll go with that

Zoë “cringe” Turner

I would counter that scones are so versatile as to be appropriate at 9.35pm. Warm, butter, basically toast. Parents are obsessed with scones aren’t they?? Were they big in the 60s

I’m reading this, it’s interesting but I’m not hooked. The vibe is a bit ‘the white book’ if you ever read that
-------------------------------------------
Are you still reading about old art ???
-------------------------------------------
(Non derogative)
-------------------------------------------
conall
20:11
might start putting this at the end of all my texts
-------------------------------------------
they are and mine LOVE them because they can put no sugar in and then say “wow they taste great, who needs sugar, this is so healthy!”. It never gets old I love it
-------------------------------------------
Never heard of the white book, or this book for that matter. Add it to the docket!
-------------------------------------------
I have mostly finished that, I am an art expert now. I forgot to load up my kindle with books before I left, so just started reading Lord of the flies cos it happened to be on there. It’s quite fun. I guess I should’ve read it by this point but there’s too many “classics” to get through
-------------------------------------------
Zoë “cringe” Turner
20:25
Will you just not include it when you’re actively trying to be mean or will you confirm derogative intentions
-------------------------------------------
Hahahaaha this is so cute, I bet they try and give you loads to take with you as well
-------------------------------------------
Oh my god WHAT. Did you never read this in school???!! My imagination is still scarred, you’re in for a weird ride there. I’m trying to remember plot points but all I can see is a dead pig

Sorry, I am notoriously bad for this. I think it’s because I don’t mind spoilers so just assume everyone else will be okay but people get so mad, rightly so. It’s like when someone makes a cup of tea for you the way they have theirs just cause that’s the way they have it (I would NEVER do this)

I’m glad of your right handed uterus story, but imagine what fact your dad would bring. Something wholesome by the sounds of it
-------------------------------------------
I ALSO had a very nice stupid evening. Couldn’t have asked for a better start to the trip. Thanks for coming out, I’d say let’s do it again but I think sticking to Manc is probably a good shout for future dates

He brought his expertise all the way from Kashmir to stone to get YOU to tiny bridgeford safely (I hope the bnb is as nice and sterile as the pics implied)

I still can’t believe this is the fact I picked for my third time meeting you, what a weird thing for you to now know
-------------------------------------------
You’re so welcome but yes let’s stay in real life territory next time. Have a good 3 hour shower / excellent sleep

I feel truly blessed. The airbnb is VERY sterile. It’s like a hospital, but one of the good ones that aren’t horrendously underfunded

I still don’t understand it. I contemplated asking some girl friends what it meant but I thought that would be weird. I don’t need to know more about your uterus, I know too much already

I’ve got two facts today
-------------------------------------------
had to force Pret Pedro into it
-------------------------------------------
he wasn’t happy but he yielded eventually
-------------------------------------------
It was in my bad books before but now it’s really down the tubes. Didn’t realise 18 year olds in Beech had such a wide dating circle. Village livin’ I guess
-------------------------------------------
Zoë “cringe” Turner
13:29
a) was this a man called Pedro who worked in Pret b) what was his quote c) are you in Shakespeare’s garden yet ??
-------------------------------------------
Well I wasn’t dating people like Liam so I had to cast the net (no offence to Liam)
-------------------------------------------
I just went to see my pal and her babies, one of them now being 3. His answer to most questions I asked him was ‘trains’ it was amazing. I guess his fact would be trains, if I was collecting them

I arrived and then fell asleep on the carpet for an hour or so

Didn’t realise how tired I was

This confuses me, but it also doesn’t matter I don’t think. No need to explain. “Liam bad” is the message I got
-------------------------------------------
fantastic child. Trains ARE great. Good that they recognise these things early on. How is your pal doing with yet another baby running about the place
-------------------------------------------
Zoë “cringe” Turner
16:16
You’re gonna be able to tell all the ones you forced because they all just say the most mundane thing they did last night but <3
-------------------------------------------
This doesn’t surprise me at all. What are you gonna do for a whole evening there??? Do you think you can find a rival pasta restaurant that also plays that one Italian classic over and over
-------------------------------------------
I don’t actually know if Liam is bad, I just know he’s the one who was in the beer garden last night and I never went out with him - anyway irrelevant
-------------------------------------------
He’s gonna be so into nationalising the railways, a bright future ahead of him. She’s doing amazingly, I was kind of awestruck. Like she’s a celeb from my past living a parallel life

18:07
proper phoned in didn’t he
-------------------------------------------
I just wandered round Stratford for a bit while having a natter with my Grandma, almost fell asleep on a bench. Tried to find a local italian but had to settle for an Ask (lame). The music is more varied, it’s just landfill indie which isn’t as good as Ave Maria repeatedly
-------------------------------------------
That’s very sweet. Being awed is a very lovely way to spend a day. Are you seeing any other entities from a past life tonight?
-------------------------------------------
Also, very big news. Very very big news

I’ve never heard this phrase before but now I want to hear it ALL the time
-------------------------------------------
The bench thing reminds me of my friend who had some kinda mid pandemic breakdown and just slept rough in Madrid for a few weeks cause he felt trapped presumably. This anecdote is just to say I hope you’re not having one of those. Your dedication to bad Italians is something to behold
-------------------------------------------
No no, I’m still trying to chill myself out / just tormenting my brother with questions about his life he doesn’t want to answer

I feel like this is a bit obnoxious of Stratford. Not sure that they OR you had to come for me and my absent postbox (but I am happy you saw them)

----- 27/9/2023 -----
conall
03:27
You ARE very funny but I am unsure why I wrote that at the end of the message. It seems out of place.

I awoke at 4am this morning. I fear my problem might be some sort of sleep apnea, but no one has ever told me I snore, just that I talk occasionally when sleeping. Maybe my sleep conversations become heated during the hours of 4/5am. I’ve downloaded a snore app, very early 2010’s of me. There’s an app for everything!
-------------------------------------------
I said it wrong, it should be “phoned IT in”, but yes it’s a top tier phrase
-------------------------------------------
That sounds absolutely awful, how did this resolve itself?

Tbh it was mostly because I needed lots of carbs. I could only find a sushi restaurant, Ask, or a pub. I tried the pub but it was one of those “oh we’re so old and cute look how low the roofs are”, I banged my head twice on some beams because I wasn’t paying attention (sleepy) and realised that life was telling me I should eat somewhere with higher ceilings.
-------------------------------------------
Fantastic way to spend an evening. It’s like a bad date but you can’t text them after and say “I had a great time but I just don’t think we’re what each other is looking for”. I hope you learned at least one new fact about his life
-------------------------------------------
I knew this would be your reaction tbh. Clearly the gold postbox thing is a sensitive topic. I’ll refrain from posting them in future, I don’t want to cause a postbox-shaped rift between us.
-------------------------------------------
Zoë “cringe” Turner
07:30
Maybe in your delirium you felt compelled to tell me, and I’ll take it. 

Ahhh no. Do you feel okay today? Still good about the ride? Yeah maybe you just shout yourself awake instead of snoring but I feel like somebody would’ve told you this too. On being funny/weird sleep habits, I forgot to tell you this when I saw you but it might make you laugh now - after the last time we hung out in Chorlton, I was in and out of sleep and KEPT waking myself up chatting/laughing like we were still having a conversation??? It was very strange. I think it’s cause I’d not wound down so the date just continued as a dream
-------------------------------------------
I think he just rode it out, he always talks about it fondly, like it’s just something he had to do. 

Hahaha. Okay well Oxford is next right?? I hope they have carbs in some other form but I do quite like the idea of you rating chain restaurants across the country as you go on only their playlists and ceiling height, food no factor
-------------------------------------------
TEXT them after???? I’ve heard you just shoot people down right in front of their noses. 

Adam’s fact yesterday was: Archie (his girlfriend’s son) isn’t really bothered about the sunflowers at mum and dad’s coming out, even though they text him photos thinking he’d be very excited, because he has his own flowers he’s growing at home now. So yeah. Don’t expect children to care about more than one flower they’re nurturing I suppose. Not sure this is something that benefits you to know
-------------------------------------------
conall
10:43
Not really that tired anymore, although what do I know. I’m clearly a bad judge of these things. Feeling good about the ride though. Just in Woodstock now, just got to Blenheim Palace. A guy asked me if I had a ticket but I just biked through the gate and they didn’t stop me. It’s like I’m in Oceans 11

Also that story is hilarious and cute in equal measure. Thanks for telling me, big fan of that anecdote. Much better than my Ikea one.
-------------------------------------------
Hahahaha, I’ll keep you updated as to the height and playlist selection. Oxford seems like another low ceiling place but I will find out soon enough. Dan is taking me to a nice chippy apparently, I think they have normal ceilings generally
-------------------------------------------
I did that ONCE and learnt my lesson. Never again. I thought it was the respectful thing to do (not waste someone’s time) but very quickly realised it is BAD. You have more innate tact than I do clearly

I didn’t need to know this fact but it seems like it’s caused quite a ruckus if you’re aware of it. I’d be glad that a kid is into one plant, let alone many plants. I wonder if Archie would eat the False Shamrock, and where would he place it on the chart
-------------------------------------------
Zoë “cringe” Turner
14:20
Well that’s good!! Absolutely amazing scenes, wish I could’ve seen this unravel in real time. Does this mean we’ve both been to big old houses today? My parents wanted to do something before they dropped me home; it was gonna be the Whitworth but I remembered that my mum wears her Sex Matters badge everywhere (anti-trans group if u don’t know) and I didn’t want the affiliation in work lmao. This is an ongoing thing with her that I have ran out of steam for. So we went to Dunham Massey instead and looked at the old stuff. I found this bowl from 1790 that’s giving 2000s Live Laugh Love/a man with his dog on Hinge:
-------------------------------------------
%[/Users/conallmcginty/Desktop/zoe-present/00000584-PHOTO-2023-09-27-15-20-38.jpg]%
-------------------------------------------
The chippy will keep your head safe I think. I didn’t realise you were meeting a pal there that’s nice!! You staying with them?
-------------------------------------------
It makes me laugh so much, that poor unsuspecting person, and you just trying to do good by her but absolutely stepping in it. I’ll stop talking about it now but just know it’s up there with my faves

Archie would probably love to eat False Shamrock and he would LOVE the chart. He once played a game with me (for too long) where he pretended to be racing the planets, but he was actually methodically ordering them - by what characteristics I don’t know - and I just had to be like OH MY GODDD every time the moon beat Saturn, as if it hadn’t been calculated
-------------------------------------------
conall
17:26
We have! I’ve never been to Dunham Massey (as you know, I am still ashamed of my museum visiting skills), I’d like to though. We should go. You’ll be bored but I’ll try to be entertaining somehow so you don’t have to see the same stuff twice. Maybe I’ll take up juggling.

I’m not glad that your Mum is like that, but part of me is because my Dad is also like that. Not the badge wearing kind, but the “I don’t have a problem with it but (insert transphobic comment here)” kind. Very tiresome. I have also given up and normally just divert the convo if it comes up. The badge is a very bold move though, when did she start this?

I LOVE this bowl, or whatever the word for ironically loving something is. Is it next to a 250 year old wood carving that says “You don’t have to be crazy to till the fields, but it helps!”
-------------------------------------------
Yeah it’s ace! He got back from work before and we’ve just been catching up. Gonna head to the chippy, then go out for a pint. He’s given me a fact. I plan to get 3 more tonight (chippy fact, pub fact x 2). I’ll let you know how I get on. You got any plans for the rest of your week off?
-------------------------------------------
I’m glad I’ve managed to provide you some entertainment with my dating ineptitude. I don’t know all these rules!

Absolutely love this about kids. They have all these games, all these ways of pleasing themselves. It’s so nice to watch. I DO agree that the moon should beat Saturn though. Pass that on if you see Archie again
-------------------------------------------
Also, I am utterly obsessed with this Nick Cave album. Very good recommendation. I have probably said this before. I can’t stop listening to it
-------------------------------------------
Zoë “cringe” Turner

Apparently it’s a nice cycle there yknow but you might not ever want to see a bike again after this week… also I wouldn’t be bored, everything would just be in a new perspective, plus if you were gonna take up juggling I’d want to witness that on its own without a fancy backdrop. 

It’s shit isn’t it? And yeah she’s super outward about it all so it’s got quite hard to ignore hence literally deciding not to bring her to the gallery - she’s just convinced herself that trans people are a threat to what she’s learned as feminism I think, and she spends too much time on Twitter, it’s classic middle class retired stuff. Very yuck. 

I don’t understand the crazy till the fields quote but please explain soon thank you 🌾🌾
-------------------------------------------
This sounds super nice, looking forward to the facts (I hope you don’t think I’m just humouring you, I’m genuinely very involved). 

I dont actually know how I’m going to spend the next two days but that’s exciting especially as I feel basically normal now. I will decide in the morning!! I went to choir for the first time in 3 weeks tonight and lost my voice for about an hour afterwards
-------------------------------------------
This pleases me. Can you name the standouts yet???? I’m desperate to cross check them
-------------------------------------------

Sounds like a plan. I will stop googling “how to juggle in a way that makes me seem more competent than I was perceived previously”. It wasn’t yielding many results anyway.

Very shit. I don’t really know what to say to my Dad anymore about it tbh, or a lot of politics stuff really. He also spends way to much time on Twitter and tbh it makes him a bit mean at times. Not a big fan of it at all AND he doesn’t have the excuse of being retired

Very bad joke tbh. I thought they might till the fields in the 1700’s I guess, so they might have a sign like this but field-tilling related. Not my finest work.
-------------------------------------------
I got no facts Zoë. Not a single fact. Outrageous. I hope this isn’t a sign of things to come. I will have to up my cajoling tomorrow.

That IS exciting. I’m glad you’re feeling better again. I meant to ask this morning at about 7am but I’d already sent you an essay by 4:30 so I figured I’d best not. Very pleased at this development.

Is this the woman’s choir? I think you mentioned this on our first date. Do you do it with anyone else you know or just rock up on your todd? The vocalist from the metal band I used to be in when I was a teenager swore by milkshakes to keep his voice from going. It seemed to work but choir voice is probably stressed differently than screaming voice. Unless you do scream at choir in which case I’d like to watch one day
-------------------------------------------
21:39
We No Who U R
Wide Lovely Eyes (possibly my favourite)
Mermaids
Finishing Jubilee Street
Higgs Boson Blues

but tbh there isn’t a bad song on there. I could write the whole track list but that wouldn’t be helpful for you

I’m off to sleep, have a lovely kip. I won’t thank you for being funny tonight. Apologies.

Competency can only be earned through authentic action - something nobody has probably ever said but that I firmly believe in. 

That’s sad I’m sorry to hear it, it does start to cause a rift. My dad laughs every time there’s a trigger warning for anything now too, like it’s the funniest thing he’s ever seen. Maybe don’t let yours retire
-------------------------------------------
NOO this is a good joke I just didn’t have the required knowledge of a) this sign and b) what “tilling” is, despite having grown up in the middle of fields probably being tilled all the time??? I’M sorry for not meeting you here, glad you ironically enjoyed the bowl though
-------------------------------------------
08:27
This seems insane and I’m going to go ahead and say it’s cause you were in Oxford and people are definitely more boring there. I bet you get loads of facts on the ferry if you just stay up all night wandering the ship. 

Hahaha - thank you!! And yes that choir. I rocked up on my Todd in January mid winter blues and now I have loads of friends I’ve made there which is really really nice. We all went to bluedot together and drowned in the mud, a true bonding experience. Maybe I’ll try a milkshake pre every rehearsal but I think that would probably make me feel a bit sick. We tend not to scream, last night we were doing Frankie Valli & The Four Seasons so not really scream-worthy. ALSO I was wondering at what point I’d learn you were in a band in a past life, this has stopped surprising me about the people I date but so far I don’t think I’ve had a metal band - the one genre I don’t really understand at all
-------------------------------------------
Thank you I’ll cross check today. It’s actually perfect for the grey weather. And I am gutted to hear you won’t be calling me hilarious every day but I suppose that was a high expectation. Hope the trip goes well today !!!

See? You ARE better at words than me. I couldn’t come up with something that poignant, especially at 9am.

Yeah it’s very lame but what can you do. I’ve said to him a few times that it does affect how we talk, but if he’s gonna ignore that then that’s up to him I suppose. He also LOVES a trigger warning. I swear they see this stuff more than I do, and I’m one of the “bloody lefties” that apparently love this stuff
-------------------------------------------
I think that’s correct because so far today I’ve already got 7 people to sign it. I’m on a mission.

Very lovely, I didn’t realise you went to BlueDot with those lot! That’s brill. I have heard of Frankie Vallie but I don’t know any songs, or is it one of those “you deffo will”

excuse the abrupt end and subsequent delay, I felt like I was about to collapse. It turns out 2 meal deals, a choc orange, 2 bags of jumbo strawbs is actually NOT enough to sustain me today. Who knew

I have obtained more food and will probably feel better momentarily

I went to Winchester once a few years ago and could hear Scouting For Girls playing somewhere close-by. Walked the other way. Hope they weren’t there again. Imagine if they had like a Vegas residency but in Winchester 

I hate to break it to you Conall but you DID decide the cycle to Paris and it WILL end eventually 

I’ve literally just been cycling, so no. Hahaha. Sat under a tree and thought oh Autumn is nice and then very quickly moved when I realised said tree was throwing conkers around
-------------------------------------------

15:48
Hahahahaha, heard the claps and fucked right off. Good move. I would like it if there were more residencies. We have one in Blackpool but it’s a guy called Joey Blower and some hypnotist that I used to do the sound for. I forget his name but the show is quite the sight. I’d suggest we’d go but I don’t even think it’d be ironically funny.

Yes THANKS _Zoë_. Today has been a very tough day. I will be sleeping on a ship also AND I may not have a way to get my bike back from Paris. Lots to organise, also that reminds me I need to book Paris accommodation.

Did you at least feel like Isaac Newton for a little bit? I’m unsure what that would feel like but you’ve got an active imagination, you can work it out
-------------------------------------------
You know what I’d love to do right now? Go on a cinema date (bad idea for a date as discussed) to one of those places with the reclining seats. I could fall asleep and no one would be any the wiser. Wouldn’t even need to tell them I wasn’t feeling it at the end, they’d be able to tell because I’d be out cold
-------------------------------------------
Zoë “cringe” Turner
16:33
Hmm. I’m usually up for these things but something about the name Joey Blower does scream to me ‘don’t go’. Did people actually get hypnotised??? Did you?? Do you think I would?????

Sorry SORRY for being facetious you are over half way and everything is going to be so fine. Tell me more about the ship sleep situation - are there beds being my main question, and how long do you get to stay on the ship? Also WHAT, why is Eurostar like this. There was plenty of room for a bike from what I remember of my one sad Eurostar journey (the Eurostar is so cool to be on by the way I don’t know if you’ve done it before but I hope you do return on it)

I didn’t feel like Isaac Newton but when I got caught in the rain just then I maybe felt a bit like you on my arduous journey from Chorlton > Gorton
-------------------------------------------
Hahahaha, I dare you. How long have you got in Portsmouth to find a cinema and a date? Take them to see Past Lives, they will be too busy crying about things that have previously happened to them to mind that you’re asleep
-------------------------------------------
I’m pretty sure the last cinema date I went on was at 9am and we saw a film about a couple who were obsessed with volcanoes; so obsessed that they died exploring one. Unsure what the thinking was behind that one

I’ve never seen Joey Blower, and yes people do! I never did obviously. I wouldn’t subject myself to that, and also I think you’ve got to give in to it to a certain degree.

I meant to send that before but my mum rudely interrupted with a phone call
-------------------------------------------
I like this. I never do this with my food. I take full advantage of global supply chains all year round. I should start, I bet it makes you feel like a chef
-------------------------------------------
Zoë “cringe” Turner
19:53
This implies the existence of many volcano films. What do you know that I don’t??
-------------------------------------------
You make it sound like I’m growing the stuff in my allotment when really I’m just thinking ‘what is warm and orange’, I know this isn’t beyond you
-------------------------------------------
ALSO I hope you’re feeling a bit better??
-------------------------------------------
conall
20:04
I’ve seen TWO volcano films
-------------------------------------------
can we have a volcano film night
-------------------------------------------
volcanos are warm and orange!
-------------------------------------------
I have eaten and tbh that’s the only reason I ever feel bad on this ride. Hungry bad, full good. I’m very low on the Maslow pyramid atm
-------------------------------------------
although I did forget to tell you about this hat I found in a bush at the side of the road today
-------------------------------------------
%[/Users/conallmcginty/Desktop/zoe-present/00000671-PHOTO-2023-09-28-21-06-19.jpg]%
-------------------------------------------
doubt I will ever wear it, but like the Royal Mail hat that I also have, the opportunity was too good to pass up
-------------------------------------------
Zoë “cringe” Turner
20:18
Yeah absolutely I’m DOWN
-------------------------------------------
Hahaha does this mean you’ll get to self-actualisation by Paris??
-------------------------------------------
Wait, no. Maybe this is you self actualised
-------------------------------------------
conall
20:28
okay now you know what I WANT to do with this (involve a system of wheels) but I feel that is too much
-------------------------------------------
I have two volcano films though
-------------------------------------------
how to pick which ones to watch
-------------------------------------------
I’m entering my final form. Thank you for validating me
-------------------------------------------
Zoë “cringe” Turner
20:34
Well
-------------------------------------------
I suppose we could split each film into themes and then see which ones marry well?? Is that how the wheels would work
-------------------------------------------
Honoured to witness it
-------------------------------------------
conall
20:44
wait I thought we had a theme (volcanos)
-------------------------------------------
Very open to the idea that I am being slow
-------------------------------------------
Zoë “cringe” Turner
20:45
Secondary themes
-------------------------------------------
conall
20:46
I like the way you think
-------------------------------------------
Zoë “cringe” Turner
20:46
Fire of Love secondary themes: companionship, dedication, risk, documentation
-------------------------------------------
conall
20:47
okay
-------------------------------------------
Volcano secondary themes: volcanos, volcanos, volcanos, and a tertiary theme of lava
-------------------------------------------
I apologise for that
-------------------------------------------
but Volcano is not a very deep film
-------------------------------------------
Zoë “cringe” Turner
20:48
Oh okay so it really is just about volcanos
-------------------------------------------
Like a film you’d watch in Geography
-------------------------------------------
conall
20:49
It’s about volcano that blows up in Los Angeles. Very bad film really
-------------------------------------------
Tommy Lee Jones phoning it right in
-------------------------------------------
Zoë “cringe” Turner
20:49
Lmao
-------------------------------------------
Right okay
-------------------------------------------
What about the other one
-------------------------------------------
conall
20:50
it is directed by the guy who directed threads though
-------------------------------------------
and threads is great, not sure what happened with Volcano
-------------------------------------------
Dante’s Peak of course!
-------------------------------------------
a classic
-------------------------------------------
Zoë “cringe” Turner
20:52
Does threads have any overlapping themes with Fire of Love because I haven’t seen it and I sense an opportunity
-------------------------------------------
You’ve seen so many disaster films - I’m inexperienced
-------------------------------------------
conall
20:55
hmmmm

I do want to watch threads
-------------------------------------------
conall
21:01
Threads
Love in The Lava Hole (or whatever your film was called)
James Bond but Rocks and Fire
Volcano
-------------------------------------------
Zoë “cringe” Turner
21:01
I’m sorry I do
-------------------------------------------
conall
21:01
I would ALSO like to watch threads
-------------------------------------------
I have listed them in order of priority based on this convo
-------------------------------------------
Zoë “cringe” Turner
21:02
What on Earth is James Bond but Rocks and Fire
-------------------------------------------
Oh Dante
-------------------------------------------
conall
21:02
maybe LITLH gets higher billing
-------------------------------------------
it started this whole thing
-------------------------------------------
Zoë “cringe” Turner
21:03
No I think Threads first, you’ve really sold it to me inadvertently
-------------------------------------------
Also is Volcano last a wise choice?
-------------------------------------------
conall
21:03
it is quite bad
-------------------------------------------
in a sort of fun way but also not at times
-------------------------------------------
okay, threads then volcano
-------------------------------------------
Zoë “cringe” Turner
21:04
Hahahaha
-------------------------------------------
Can’t wait to find out what kind of volcano experience I’m gonna have
-------------------------------------------
conall
21:04
some harrowing darkness, followed by some Tommy Lee Jones idiocy
-------------------------------------------
Zoë “cringe” Turner
21:04
If Volcano goes last I think I will say no
-------------------------------------------
conall
21:04
now THATS an evening
-------------------------------------------
Zoë “cringe” Turner
21:04
So yeah bump it up
-------------------------------------------
conall
21:05
THREADS
FOL
VOL
BROZ
-------------------------------------------
you’re gonna love it
-------------------------------------------
Don Cheadle is also in it
-------------------------------------------
and he’s NEVER in anything terrible
-------------------------------------------
Zoë “cringe” Turner
21:06
Ok perfect
-------------------------------------------
FOL isn’t that harrowing by the way it’s more beautiful than anything
-------------------------------------------
conall
21:06
I’m excited to watch it
-------------------------------------------
Zoë “cringe” Turner
21:06
In case that changes things
-------------------------------------------
conall
21:06
it does sound cute
-------------------------------------------
we need a real pallet cleanser after threads
-------------------------------------------
palet?
-------------------------------------------
palett?
-------------------------------------------
none of these look right, whatever
-------------------------------------------
Zoë “cringe” Turner
21:07
I think you were right the first time
-------------------------------------------
Why is it called threads?
-------------------------------------------
It’s making me think about threadworm and that app that’s trying to be Twitter but is just word Instagram
-------------------------------------------
conall
21:08
I don’t think it’s mentioned in the film
-------------------------------------------
it leaves a lot to the imagination tbh, but I really enjoyed it
-------------------------------------------
i watched it ages ago but i remember it well
-------------------------------------------
although my memory is absolutely awful so take that with a grain of salt
-------------------------------------------
what’s threadworm
-------------------------------------------
do I want to know this?
-------------------------------------------
Zoë “cringe” Turner
21:24
Is it one of those memories that’s purely feeling
-------------------------------------------
Like when you try and relay a book you’re sure you loved to someone but there’s 0 plot left in your head
-------------------------------------------
No I don’t think so x
-------------------------------------------
I think I’m jealous that you’re on a boat for some reason
-------------------------------------------
conall
21:32
you’ve articulated it very well
-------------------------------------------
after we watched it at my mates house we just sort of sat around in silence for 5/10 minutes
-------------------------------------------
it was a lot
-------------------------------------------
you should be it’s very fun
-------------------------------------------
I asked the desk if I could go to the brig as a joke (I’m not sure what the brig is) and they said they need to ask their manager
-------------------------------------------
I said not to bother because I was joking but the language barrier got in the way so I ran off to my room, which feels exactly like my room in uni halls

To clarify I have never read THE Odyssey either but I’ve just realised that Lara Williams (weird cruise odyssey writer) was definitely doing a literature bit that I missed

Nah they don’t this is underwhelming

I appreciate photo > real life discrepancy though

The it’s nice to hear your voice thing is really sweet but also a bit dramatic like you’re away at war
-------------------------------------------
conall
21:50
yes I did think it sounded very lame
-------------------------------------------
but I’d already recorded the voice message 3 times
-------------------------------------------
and tbh it got more unnatural as I re-recorded it, but then the nice voice thing snuck in on the third recording

I’m sitting on the grass because I’ve just bought Ryan loads of books from blackwells before I go to his because I was a BAD friend and didn’t get him birthday presents on time. I hope he likes them.

Do you listen to your own voice notes back

And if you were stuck for eternity doing ONE THING what would it be

listening to my own voice notes

answer to this is implied by the previous answer

Zoë “cringe” Turner

I really don’t know
-------------------------------------------
anything would get boring

there’s not really a good answer

I do listen to mine usually to affirm myself

how does it affirm

actually

you DO have a very nice voice

if I was you I’d probably enjoy listening to mine

also I never listened to this. Oops

It’s less this and more ‘oh yes I communicated that well :)’

I like yours. For some reason I can hear the Blackpool way more than when you’re in front of me

I think it’s because I am more excitable in person, much easier to keep a lid on it when you’re talking to a black rectangle

I DID listen to it and forgot most of it but I do remember being impressed you did it off the dome

I’m just gonna head to Planet Mars because that seems like a fun place to go. Unsure of the ceiling height or the cuisine. I hope it’s Mars based food

Did I set this in motion on Monday?
-------------------------------------------
And why are there 3 different tiramisus
-------------------------------------------
James has put Peter Kay on the tele - this is an ongoing bit here because I watched a Peter Kay set for the first time some months ago at theirs and kept deeming him ‘the next big thing’ and ‘my greatest discovery’. We all found it hilarious but I don’t know if it translates outside of the group. This is my test

it’s possible she’s a big Peter Kay fan

-------------------------------------------
bit of wall and ceiling (the most important bit)
-------------------------------------------
also how have you never seen Peter Kay? Is this a stoke thing? Maybe you’re just passed the cutoff. I feel like he has been inescapable my whole life.

I tried to show my Russian ex Phoenix Night’s (ask your mates, they’ll know if you don’t). She did NOT get it at all, even though she had lived in London for about a decade. Too much north.
-------------------------------------------
Zoë “cringe” Turner

A Futurama mural! The epitome of French/Italian class
-------------------------------------------
This was also their question, I don’t know the answer - I have a vague memory of my mum pissing herself whenever he was on the TV, but I think maybe I was a bit young to pay attention. Also I’m not actually northern am I 

I think we saw a bit of Phoenix Nights when I discovered him. Ryan says it probably wouldn’t be made now as at one point he plays a man in a wheelchair
-------------------------------------------
Also I’ve just shaved my eyebrow for style purposes. I think everyone at work tomorrow is just going to be like, what have you done to your eyebrow
-------------------------------------------
conall
19:31
Sorry to be the bearer of bad news but it’s the simpsons / wall-e
-------------------------------------------
although WALL-e is a great theme for a mural

That’s very true you’re not but I don’t understand what is or isn’t northern tbh.

It’s not at one point, it’s his character the entire show!

fantastic, glad you’re out (presumably) having fun
-------------------------------------------
hahahaha very understanding of you. I have found clothes, pints and a tiny arc de triomphe, I am very pleased with myself for this whole thing now. Who doesn’t love a little self-imposed hardship every now and again
-------------------------------------------
also don’t worry yourself about venting honestly it’s fine. It sounds shit but you’ll get it sorted one way or another. EVENTUALLY that guy has to go to the toilet or something
-------------------------------------------
also look what I just walked past, I had no idea this was a real place (I am very cultured)
