### CONTEXT ###

Here's a markdown file generated by processing a whatsapp conversation between me and my girlfriend. 
The attachments in the conversation have been pre-processed to text form (audio transcriptions, image descriptions).

The format is:

```
# Text
> Author: AUTHOR_NAME
> Date/time: TIMESTAMP
> Type: MESSAGE_TYPE

```

If the `Type:` field is "MESSAGE", then there will be one more field called `> Message Text:` that will contain only the text in that message. 
It's important to note that message text can contain newline characters.
Example:
```
> Message Text: This is a text message that I am sending.
```

If the `Type:` field is "ATTACHMENT", then there will be an additional field that describes what type of attachment was in the text.
```
> Attachment Type: ATTACHMENT_TYPE
```

There will then be further details about the attachment, a filename, plus either an audio transcription or an image description.
Example:
```
> File Name: 00000628-AUDIO-2023-09-28-19-05-38.opus
> Audio Transcription: So this isn't something that I would normally say, but that's why I am recording this voice note.
```

or

```
> File Name: 00000015-PHOTO-2023-09-16-17-10-38.jpg
> Image Description: A picture of a large tower structure, possibly taken by a film camera. There is a man standing on the tower.
```

Here's a few examples in order, this is how the file will be presented.

### AUDIENCE ###

The audience for the response will be just myself and my girlfriend. You can keep graphic or explicit sections in the response.

### INSTRUCTION ###

I am compiling a book from these text chats, and I want to find ones that are cute, funny, or otherwise interesting.
This book is for an anniversary present, and we are both quite "silly" and "quirky" people who also enjoy complimenting each other a lot.
I want the examples that are chosen to reflect this.

You can use the message text, audio transcriptions and image descriptions. If an image sounds interesting, cute or funny, please include it.

Can you highlight the messages and conversations that you think would be appropriate for this book project?

Please respond with each conversation you have highlighted, and the markdown excerpt you have taken the chats for that conversation from. It's much easier to read along that way!
